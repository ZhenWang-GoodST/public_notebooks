AB  - The application of robots in inspection tasks has been growing quickly thanks to the advancements in autonomous navigation technology, especially the robot localization techniques in GPS-denied environments. Although many methods have been proposed to localize a robot using onboard sensors such as cameras and LiDARs, achieving robust localization in geometrically degenerated environments, e.g. tunnels, remains a challenging problem. In this work, we focus on the robust localization problem in such situations. A novel degeneration characterization model is presented to estimate the localizability at a given location in the prior map. And the localizability of a LiDAR and an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging radio is analyzed. Additionally, a probabilistic sensor fusion method is developed to combine IMU, LiDAR and the UWB. Experiment results show that this method allows for robust localization inside a long straight tunnel.

AB  - Global localization lies at the heart of autonomous navigation and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The appearance-based approach has been successful, but still faces many open challenges in environments where visual conditions vary significantly over time. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution to leverage object-level dense semantics and spatial understanding of the environment for global localization. Our approach models an environment with 3D dense semantics, semantic graph and their topology. This object-level representation is then used for place recognition via semantic object association, followed by 6-DoF pose estimation by the semantic-level point alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve robust global localization under extreme appearance changes. It is also capable of coping with other challenging scenarios, such as dynamic environments and incomplete query observations.

AB  - Visual place recognition (VPR) - the act of recognizing a familiar visual place - becomes difficult when there is extreme environmental appearance change or viewpoint change. Particularly challenging is the scenario where both phenomena occur simultaneously, such as when returning for the first time along a road at night that was previously traversed during the day in the opposite direction. While such problems can be solved with panoramic sensors, humans solve this problem regularly with limited field-of-view vision and without needing to constantly turn around. In this paper, we present a new depth- and temporal-aware visual place recognition system that solves the opposing viewpoint, extreme appearance-change visual place recognition problem. Our system performs sequence-to-single frame matching by extracting depth-filtered keypoints using a state-of-the-art depth estimation pipeline, constructing a keypoint sequence over multiple frames from the reference dataset, and comparing these keypoints to the keypoints extracted from a single query image. We evaluate the system on a challenging benchmark dataset and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. We also develop a range of diagnostic simulation experiments that characterize the contribution of depth-filtered keypoint sequences with respect to key domain parameters including the degree of appearance change and camera motion.

AB  - Service robots require the ability to recognize various household objects in order to carry out certain tasks, such as fetching an object for a person. Manually collecting information on all the objects a robot may encounter in a household is tedious and time-consuming; therefore this paper proposes the use of large-scale data from existing trademark databases. These databases contain logo images and a description of the goods and services the logo was registered under. For example, Pepsi is registered under soft drinks. We extend domain randomization in order to generate synthetic data to train a convolutional neural network logo detector, which outperformed previous logo detectors trained on synthetic data. We also provide a practical implementation for object fetching on a robot, which uses a Kinect and the logo detector to identify the object the human user requested. Tests on this robot indicate promising results, despite not using any real world photos for training.

In order to detect the good grasping poses for a parallel gripper from RGB images, we have employed transfer learning for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detection architecture. Our obtained results show that, the adapted network either outperforms or is on-par with the state-of-the art methods on a benchmark dataset. We also performed grasping experiments on a real robot platform to evaluate our method's real world performance.

AB  - Data-driven approach for grasping shows significant advance recently. But these approaches usually require much training data. To increase the efficiency of grasping data collection, this paper presents a novel grasp training system including the whole pipeline from data collection to model inference. The system can collect effective grasp sample with a corrective strategy assisted by antipodal grasp rule, and we design an affordance interpreter network to predict pixelwise grasp affordance map. We define graspability, ungraspability and background as grasp affordances. The key advantage of our system is that the pixel-level affordance interpreter network trained with only a small number of grasp samples under antipodal rule can achieve significant performance on totally unseen objects and backgrounds. The training sample is only collected in simulation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our proposed approach. In the real-world grasp experiments, we achieve a grasp success rate of 93% on a set of household items and 91% on a set of adversarial items with only about 6,300 simulated samples. We also achieve 87% accuracy in clutter scenario. Although the model is trained using only RGB image, when changing the background textures, it also performs well and can achieve even 94% accuracy on the set of adversarial objects, which outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - We report the feasibility study of a new acoustic and optical bi-modal distance & material sensor for robotic grasping. The new sensor is designed to be mounted on the robot fingertip to provide last-moment perception before contact happens. It is based on both pulse-echo ultrasound and optoacoustic effects enabled by single-element air-coupled transducers. In contrast to conventional contact-based and recent pre-touch approaches, this new method overcomes their disadvantages and provides robotic fingers with the capability to detect the distance and material type of the target at a near distance before contact occurs, which is crucial for robust and nimble grasping. The proposed sensor has been tested with different materials, shapes, and porous properties. The experimental results show that this sensor design is functional and practical.

AB  - Among the currently available grasp-type selection techniques for hand prostheses, there is a distinct lack of intuitive, robust, low-latency solutions. In this paper we investigate the use of a portable, forearm-mounted, video-based technique for the prediction of hand-grasp preshaping for arbitrary objects. The purpose of this system is to automatically select the grasp-type for the user of the prosthesis, potentially increasing ease-of-use and functionality. This system can be used to supplement and improve existing control strategies, such as surface electromyography (sEMG) pattern recognition, for prosthetic and orthotic devices. We designed and created a suitable dataset consisting of RGB-D video data for 2212 grasp examples split evenly across 7 classes; 6 grasps commonly used in activities of daily living, and an additional no-grasp category. We processed and analyzed the dataset using several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Our selected model shows promising results for realistic, intuitive, real-world use, reaching per-frame accuracies on video sequences of up to 95.90% on the validation set. Such a system could be integrated into the palm of a hand prosthesis, allowing an automatic prediction of the grasp-type without requiring any special movements or aiming by the user.

AB  - In this paper, we look at the challenge of human robot interaction in locomotion. We consider a hand-in-hand interaction scenario where a human compliantly interacts with the upper-body of an impedance controlled humanoid. By exploring the velocity transmission of the robot arms, and the interaction in terms of robot arms manipulation quality evaluated through the monitoring of their manipulability the proposed method derives suitable reactive steps in appropriate directions to ensure that the robot manipulation ability is maintained with the robot arms providing high capacity of motion along the different directions. The proposed approach can be combined with different walking pattern generators and is not tailored to a specific one used in this work. The results of the proposed method are experimentally validated on the COMAN + humanoid robot showing the efficacy of the method to generate reactive stepping driven by the interaction and manipulation motion of the human operator. Besides, the work also provides a real-time software architecture to control humanoid COMAN+, but it is also flexible to be used for the control of other robot platforms.

AB  - Human Robot interaction is a fundamental perquisite for any robot performing a physical task in collaboration with a human. The presence of disturbances arising from the partially known tasks payloads, the unexpected interaction forces in general, and the uncertainty in the interpretation of the human intention in terms of motions and forces can pose significant challenges and eventually compromise the execution of the collaborative task. This work presents a novel, intrinsically adaptable multimodal (force, motion and verbal) interaction framework for human-robot collaboration (HRC) that leverages on an online self-tuning stiffness regulation principle to provide adaptation to interaction/payload forces and reject disturbances arising by unexpected interaction loads. Besides the presented method, it enables the rejection of unnecessary motion commands (e.g. oscillations generated by the human operator) to reach the robot co-worker through the filtering of the human generated motions, that are outside the range (in terms of speed and acceleration) of the envisioned manipulation manoeuvres. Finally, a verbal interaction channel allows the operator to convey securely his high level intentions and to control the states of the task execution. We evaluated and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal interaction framework in a high weight carrying human-robot collaboration task using the humanoid robot COMAN +.

AB  - This paper combines techniques from Formal Methods and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to address the challenge of a robot walking with a human while maintaining a socially acceptable distance and avoiding collisions. We formulate a set of constraints on the robot motion using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formulas, and synthesize robot control that is guaranteed to be safe and correct. Due to its use of high-level formal specifications, the controller is able to provide feedback to the user in situations where human behavior causes the robot to fail. This feedback allows the human to adjust their behavior and recover joint navigation. We demonstrate the behavior of the robot in a variety of simulated scenarios and compare it to utility-based side-by-side navigation control.

AB  - In this work, we propose an algorithm that can plan safe and efficient robot trajectories in real time, given time-parameterized motion predictions, in order to avoid fast-moving obstacles in human-robot collaborative environments. Our algorithm is able to reduce the robot configuration space and the time domain significantly by constructing a Lazy Safe Interval Probabilistic Roadmap based on a pre-planned path. The algorithm then plans efficient obstacle-avoidance strategies within the space-time roadmap. We benchmarked our algorithm by evaluating the performance of a simulated 6-joint manipulator attempting to avoid a quickly moving human hand, using a dataset collected from human experiments. We compared our algorithm's performance with those of 8 variations of prior state-of-the-art planners. Results from this empirical evaluation indicate that our method generated safe plans in 97.5% of the evaluated situations, achieved a planning speed 30 times faster than the benchmarked methods that planned in the time domain without space reduction, and accomplished the minimal solution execution time among the benchmarked planners with a similar planning speed.

AB  - Augmenting a robot with the capacity to understand the activities of the people it collaborates with in order to then label and segment those activities allows the robot to generate an efficient and safe plan for performing its own actions. In this work, we introduce an online activity segmentation algorithm that can detect activity segments by processing a partial trajectory. We model the transitions through activities as a hidden Markov model, which runs online by implementing an efficient particle-filtering approach to infer the maximum a posteriori estimate of the activity sequence. This process is complemented by an online search process to refine activity segments using task model information about the partial order of activities. We evaluated our algorithm by comparing its performance to two state-of-the-art activity segmentation algorithms on three human activity datasets. The proposed algorithm improved activity segmentation accuracy across all three datasets compared with the other two approaches, with a range from 11.3% to 65.5%, and could accurately recognize an activity through observation alone for 31.6% of the initial trajectory of that activity, on average. We also implemented the algorithm onto an industrial mobile robot during an automotive assembly task in which the robot tracked a human worker's progress and provided the worker with the correct materials at the appropriate time.

AB  - Assessment of minimally invasive surgical skills is a non-trivial task, usually requiring the presence and time of expert observers, including subjectivity and requiring special and expensive equipment and software. This study develops an algorithm for tracking laparoscopy instruments in the video cues of a standard laparoscopy training box with a single webcam camera and proposes new criteria to assess skill level using the extracted tool trajectories. Instrument tracking and assessment criteria together constitute a significant step towards developing a low cost, automated, and widely applicable laparoscopy training and assessment system using a standard physical training box equipped with a webcam. The developed visual tracking algorithm recovers the 3D positions of the laparoscopic instruments tips to which simple colored tapes (markers) are attached. The new assessment criteria are based on frequency analysis and linear discriminant analysis of the 3D reconstructed trajectories of the instruments. The performance of these proposed criteria are compared to the conventional criteria for laparoscopy training and demonstrated to be superior on the data we have recorded from six professional laparoscopy surgeons and ten novice subjects.

AB  - Navigating surgical tools in the dynamic and tortuous anatomy of the lung's airways requires accurate, real-time localization of the tools with respect to the preoperative scan of the anatomy. Such localization can inform human operators or enable closed-loop control by autonomous agents, which would require accuracy not yet reported in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning architecture, called OffsetNet, to accurately localize a bronchoscope in the lung in real-time. After training on only 30 minutes of recorded camera images in conserved regions of a lung phantom, OffsetNet tracks the bronchoscope's motion on a held-out recording through these same regions at an update rate of 47 Hz and an average position error of 1.4 mm. Because this model performs poorly in less conserved regions, we augment the training dataset with simulated images from these regions. To bridge the gap between camera and simulated domains, we implement domain randomization and a generative adversarial network (GAN). After training on simulated images, OffsetNet tracks the bronchoscope's motion in less conserved regions at an average position error of 2.4 mm, which meets conservative thresholds required for successful tracking.

AB  - Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery allows for easy recording of kinematic data, and presents excellent opportunities for data-intensive approaches to assessment of surgical skill, system design, and automation of procedures. However, typical surgical cases result in long data streams, and therefore, automated segmentation into gestures is important. The public release of the JIGSAWS dataset allowed for developing and benchmarking data-intensive segmentation algorithms. However, this dataset is small and the gestures are similar in their structure and directions. This may limit the generalization of the algorithms to real surgical data that are characterized by movements in arbitrary directions. In this paper, we use a recurrent neural network to segment a suturing task, and demonstrate one such generalization problem-limited generalization to rotation. We propose a simple augmentation that can solve this problem without collecting new data, and demonstrate its benefit using: (1) the JIGSAWS dataset, and (2) a new dataset that we recorded with a da Vinci Research Kit. Our study highlights the prospect of using data augmentation in the analysis of kinematic data in surgical data science.

AB  - The synchronization of the movement between exoskeleton robot and human arm is crucial for Robot-assisted training (RAT) in upper limb rehabilitation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based motion prediction model which is applied to our recently developed 8 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) upper limb rehabilitation exoskeleton, named NTUH-II. The human arm dynamics and surface electromyography (sEMG) can be first measured by two wireless sensors and used as input of deep learning model to predict user's motion. Then, the prediction can be used as desired motion trajectory of the exoskeleton. As a result, the robot arm can follow the movement on either side of the user's arm in real-time. Various experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed motion prediction model, and the results show that the proposed motion prediction implementation can reduce the mean absolute error and the average delay time of movement between human arm and robot arm.

AB  - Lower-limb exoskeleton has gained considerable interests in walking assistance applications for paraplegic patients. In walking assistance of paraplegic patients, the exoskeleton should have the ability to help patients to walk over different terrains in the daily life, such as slope terrains. One critical issue is how to plan the stepping locations on slopes with different gradients, and generate stable and human-like gaits for patients. This paper proposed an adaptive gait planning approach which can generate gait trajectories adapt to slopes with different gradients for lower-limb walking assistance exoskeletons. We modeled the human-exoskeleton system as a 2D Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (2D-LIPM) with an external force in the two-dimensional sagittal plane, and proposed a Dynamic Gait Generator (DGG) based on an extension of the conventional Capture Point (CP) theory and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs). The proposed approach can dynamically generate reference foot locations for each step on slopes, and human-like adaptive gait trajectories can be reproduced after the learning from demonstrated trajectories that sampled from level ground walking of normal healthy human. We demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach on both the Gazebo simulation platform and an exoskeleton named AIDER. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is able to provide the ability for exoskeletons to generate appropriate gaits adapt to slopes with different gradients.

AB  - Modeling individual-specific gait dynamics based on kinematic data could aid development of gait rehabilitation robotics by enabling robots to predict the user's gait kinematics with and without external inputs, such as mechanical or electrical perturbations. Here we address a current limitation of data-driven gait models, which do not yet predict human gait dynamics nor responses to perturbations. We used Switched Linear Dynamical Systems (SLDS) to model joint angle kinematic data from healthy individuals walking on a treadmill during normal gait and during gait perturbed by functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the ankle muscles. Our SLDS models were able to generate joint angle trajectories in each of four gait phases, as well as across an entire gait cycle, given initial conditions and gait phase information. Because the SLDS dynamics matrices encoded significant coupling across joints that differed across indivdiuals, we compared the SLDS predictions to that of a kinematic model, where the joint angles were independent. Joint angle trajectories generated by SLDS and kinematic models were similar over time horizons of a few milliseconds, but SLDS models provided better predictions of gait kinematics over time horizons of up to a second. We also demonstrated that SLDS models can infer and predict individual-specific responses to FES during swing phase. As such, SLDS models may be a promising approach for online estimation and control of and human gait dynamics, allowing robotic control strategies to be tailored to an individual's specific gait coordination patterns.

AB  - Myoelectric prosthetic hand users have difficulty with, and frequently avoid, grasping fragile objects with their prosthesis. While the sense of touch is known to be critical for human hand dexterity, it has been virtually absent in prosthetic hands. In this study, a standard myoelectric prosthetic hand was modified with tactile sensors and a simple tactile reflex to inhibit excessive forces on contact. The tactile sensors were made from an open-cell self-skinning polyurethane foam that produced a detectable increase in air pressure inside the foam when contacted. This contact signal was then used by an inhibitory reflex controller which served to reduce the gain of weaker closing signals after contact but allow stronger closing signals to pass through. Four unilateral myoelectric prosthesis users completed five trials of three different timed grasping tasks with fragile and rigid items. Subjects performed each task in three different scenarios: with their sound side limb, their current myoelectric hand, and the modified prosthesis with tactile reflex. Findings demonstrated that grasping performance with fragile objects was significantly enhanced using the modified prosthesis, even nearing the performance of subject's sound side limb. Results suggest that this approach can substantially improve the speed and success of grasping fragile items, leading to improved use patterns, decreased cognitive effort, and improved user confidence.

AB  - Mechanical stresses on the spine are a significant risk factor for low back pain, a highly prevalent health problem around the world. Certain occupational activities such as repetitive heavy lifting and static bending posture lead to high loads on the lower back. To address this problem, we are developing a soft power suit capable of reducing physical load on the lower back during dynamic lifting and static forward bending. The power suit is designed to mimic the force transmission in the body and duplicate the force generated by muscles and tendons. Two twisted string actuators (TSAs) attached to a back brace are used to generate tensile forces which assist the underlying muscles to control trunk flexion. The fabric construction and TSA enable a lightweight design of the suit: without the battery, the entire system weighs only 2.4kg. Here we present the design and implementation of the prototype system along with a preliminary biomechanical study that evaluates the effect of the system on the body. The results show that the power suit does not change the wearer's bending kinematics and helps the subject to keep the static bending posture. Moreover, using the power suit significantly reduced the muscle activation required for both static bending and dynamic lifting (50.2-54.0% and 21.4-25.2% reduction, respectively).

Fingertip applications benefit from the changes of stiffness and volume which take place in our hydrogel when electric fields are applied.

AB  - Soft robots undergo large nonlinear spatial deformations due to both inherent actuation and external loading. The physics underlying these deformations is complex, and often requires intricate analytical and numerical models. The complexity of these models may render traditional model-based control difficult and unsuitable. Model-free methods offer an alternative for analyzing the behavior of such complex systems without the need for elaborate modeling techniques. In this paper, we present a model-free approach for open loop position control of a soft spatial continuum arm, based on deep reinforcement learning. The continuum arm is pneumatically actuated and attains a spatial work-space by a combination of unidirectional bending and bidirectional torsional deformation. We use Deep-Q Learning with experience replay to train the system in simulation. The efficacy and robustness of the control policy obtained from the system is validated both in simulation and on the continuum arm prototype for varying external loading conditions.

AB  - We present an efficient algorithm for motion planning and controlling a robot system with a high number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF). These systems include high-DOF soft robots and articulated robots interacting with a deformable environment. We present a novel technique to accelerate the evaluations of the forward dynamics function by storing the results of costly computations in a hierarchical adaptive grid. Furthermore, we exploit the underactuated properties of the robot systems and build the grid in a low-dimensional space. Our approach approximates the forward dynamics function with guaranteed error bounds and can be used in optimization-based motion planning and reinforcement-learning-based feed-back control. We highlight the performance on two high-DOF robot systems: a line-actuated elastic robot arm and an underwater swimming robot in water. Compared to prior techniques based on exact dynamics evaluation, we observe one to two orders of magnitude improvement in the performance.

AB  - Soft robots utilize compliant materials to perform motions and behaviors not typically achievable by rigid bodied systems. These materials and soft actuator fabrication methods have been leveraged to create multigait walking soft robots. However, soft materials are prone to failure, restricting the ability of soft robots to accomplish tasks. In this work we address the problem of generating reactive controllers for multigait walking soft robots that are resilient to actuator failure by applying methods of formal synthesis. We present a sensing-based abstraction for actuator performance, provide a framework for encoding multigait behavior and actuator failure in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), and demonstrate synthesized controllers on a physical soft robot.

AB  - This article presents the design of soft material robots with tunable damping properties. This study derives from the investigation of an under-actuated dynamic approach involving multi-chamber pneumatic systems. The co-design of the mechanical parameters (stiffness and damping) of the system along with the time profile of the input allows to obtain different behaviors using a reduced number of feeding line. In this work we analyze via simulations and experiments several approaches to tune the damping of soft robots. The most effective solution employs a layer of granular material immersed in viscous oil within the chamber wall. This method has been employed to realize bending actuators with a continuous deformation pattern. Finally, we show an application involving a two-fingered gripper fed by a single pneumatic line, which is able to perform pinch and power grasp.

AB  - In robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, the first assistant (FA) stands at the bedside assisting the intervention, while the surgeon sits at the console teleoperating the robot. Tasks for the FA include navigating new instruments into the surgeon's field-of-view and passing in or retracting materials from the body using hand-held tools. We previously developed ARssist, an augmented reality application based on an optical see-through head-mounted display, to aid the FA. In this paper, we refine the system and first perform a pilot study with three experienced surgeons for two specific tasks: instrument insertion and tool manipulation. The results suggest that ARssist would be especially useful for less experienced assistants and for difficult hand-eye configurations. We then perform a multi-user study with inexperienced subjects. The results show that ARssist can reduce navigation time by 34.57%, enhance insertion path consistency by 41.74%, reduce root-mean-square path deviation by 40.04%, and reduce tool manipulation time by 72.25%. Thus, ARssist has the potential to improve efficiency, safety and hand-eye coordination, especially for novice assistants.

AB  - This paper presents a design that jointly provides hand pose sensing, hand localization, and haptic feedback to facilitate real-time stable grasps in Virtual Reality (VR). The design is based on an easy-to-replicate glove-based system that can reliably perform (i) a high-fidelity hand pose sensing in real time through a network of 15 IMUs, and (ii) the hand localization using a Vive Tracker. The supported physics-based simulation in VR is capable of detecting collisions and contact points for virtual object manipulation, which drives the collision event to trigger the physical vibration motors on the glove to signal the user, providing a better realism inside virtual environments. A caging-based approach using collision geometry is integrated to determine whether a grasp is stable. In the experiment, we showcase successful grasps of virtual objects with large geometry variations. Comparing to the popular LeapMotion sensor, we demonstrate the proposed glove-based design yields a higher success rate in various tasks in VR. We hope such a glove-based system can simplify the data collection of human manipulations with VR.

AB  - Robotic teleoperation enables humans to safely complete exploratory procedures in remote locations for applications such as deep sea exploration or building assessments following natural disasters. Successful task completion requires meaningful dual arm robotic coordination and proper understanding of the environment. While these capabilities are inherent to humans via impedance regulation and haptic interactions, they can be challenging to achieve in telerobotic systems. Teleimpedance control has allowed impedance regulation in such applications, and bilateral teleoperation systems aim to restore haptic sensation to the operator, though often at the expense of stability or workspace size. Wearable haptic devices have the potential to apprise the operator of key forces during task completion while maintaining stability and transparency. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of wearable haptics for force feedback in teleimpedance control for dual-arm robotic teleoperation. Participants completed a peg-in-hole, box placement task, aiming to seat as many boxes as possible within the trial period. Experiments were conducted both transparent and opaque boxes. With the opaque box, participants achieved a higher number of successful placements with haptic feedback, and we saw higher mean interaction forces. Results suggest that the provision of wearable haptic feedback may increase confidence when visual cues are obscured.

AB  - Reliable feature correspondence between frames is a critical step in visual odometry (VO) and visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) algorithms. In comparison with existing VO and V-SLAM algorithms, semi-direct visual odometry (SVO) has two main advantages that lead to state-of-the-art frame rate camera motion estimation: direct pixel correspondence and efficient implementation of probabilistic mapping method. This paper improves the SVO mapping by initializing the mean and the variance of the depth at a feature location according to the depth prediction from a single-image depth prediction network. By significantly reducing the depth uncertainty of the initialized map point (i.e., small variance centred about the depth prediction), the benefits are twofold: reliable feature correspondence between views and fast convergence to the true depth in order to create new map points. We evaluate our method with two outdoor datasets: KITTI dataset and Oxford Robotcar dataset. The experimental results indicate that improved SVO mapping results in increased robustness and camera tracking accuracy. The implementation of this work is available at https: //github.com/yan99033/CNN-SVO.

AB  - This paper presents a novel framework for simultaneously implementing localization and segmentation, which are two of the most important vision-based tasks for robotics. While the goals and techniques used for them were considered to be different previously, we show that by making use of the intermediate results of the two modules, their performance can be enhanced at the same time. Our framework is able to handle both the instantaneous motion and long-term changes of instances in localization with the help of the segmentation result, which also benefits from the refined 3D pose information. We conduct experiments on various datasets, and prove that our framework works effectively on improving the precision and robustness of the two tasks and outperforms existing localization and segmentation algorithms.

AB  - We propose a new multi-instance dynamic RGB-D SLAM system using an object-level octree-based volumetric representation. It can provide robust camera tracking in dynamic environments and at the same time, continuously estimate geometric, semantic, and motion properties for arbitrary objects in the scene. For each incoming frame, we perform instance segmentation to detect objects and refine mask boundaries using geometric and motion information. Meanwhile, we estimate the pose of each existing moving object using an object-oriented tracking method and robustly track the camera pose against the static scene. Based on the estimated camera pose and object poses, we associate segmented masks with existing models and incrementally fuse corresponding colour, depth, semantic, and foreground object probabilities into each object model. In contrast to existing approaches, our system is the first system to generate an object-level dynamic volumetric map from a single RGB-D camera, which can be used directly for robotic tasks. Our method can run at 2-3 Hz on a CPU, excluding the instance segmentation part. We demonstrate its effectiveness by quantitatively and qualitatively testing it on both synthetic and real-world sequences.

AB  - Achieving high surface reconstruction accuracy in dense mapping has been a desirable target for both robotics and vision communities. In the robotics literature, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems use RGB-D cameras to reconstruct a dense map of the environment. They leverage the depth input to provide accurate local pose estimation and a locally consistent model. However, drift in the pose tracking over time leads to misalignments and artifacts. On the other hand, offline computer vision methods, such as the pipeline that combines structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS), estimate the camera poses by performing batch optimization. These methods achieve global consistency, but suffer from heavy computation loads. We propose a novel approach that integrates both methods to achieve locally and globally consistent reconstruction. First, we estimate poses of keyframes in the offline SfM pipeline to provide strong global constraints at relatively low cost. Afterwards, we compute odometry between frames driven by off-the-shelf SLAM systems with high local accuracy. We fuse the two pose estimations using factor graph optimization to generate accurate camera poses for dense reconstruction. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate models comparing to existing dense SLAM systems, while achieving significant speedup with respect to state-of-the-art SfM-MVS pipelines.

We built an AR application that works on HoloLens and allows the operator to view the robot's map superposed on the physical environment and edit it. Through map editing, the operator can account for errors affecting real environment's representation by adding navigation-forbidden areas to the map in addition to the ability to correct errors affecting the localization. The proposed system allows the operator to edit the robot's pose (based on SLAM request) and can be extended to sending navigation goals to the robot, viewing the planned path to evaluate it before execution, and teleoperating the robot. The proposed solution could be applied on any 2D-based SLAM algorithm and can easily be extended to 3D SLAM techniques. We validated our system through experimentation on pose correction and map editing. Experiments demonstrated that through A-SLAM, SLAM runtime is cut to half, post-processing of maps is totally eliminated, and high quality occupancy grid maps could be achieved with minimal added computational and hardware costs.

AB  - This paper proposes an analysis of walking balance in terms of movements of stance and swing legs based on an inverted pendulum and a simple pendulum. Linearization, decoupling, and non-dimensionalization of a compass gait model enable to characterize the relationship of the trajectories between the stance and swing legs by only two parameters (energy ratio and phase difference). The energy ratio is defined by the ratio of the orbital energy between the pendulums. The phase difference represents the position of the stance leg in relation to the swing leg. This study considers an orbital energy conservation of a step transition and analyzes reachability of a desirable touchdown condition. If the time evolution from a current state is not reachable to the desired touchdown region, the state is labeled as a state in balance loss. By analyzing the reachability limits of the energy ratio and phase difference, we illustrate the balance loss and safe regions on the state space of the inverted pendulum, which is termed as balance map. We examined the effects of the simplification and linearization of the compass gait model by using computer simulations. Through the simulations of walking with perturbations, we confirmed that the balance map analysis could predict a future fall in an early phase for even trajectories derived by the nonlinear model.

AB  - Unstructured environments impose several challenges when robots are required to perform different tasks and adapt to unseen situations. In this context, a relevant problem arises: how can robots learn to perform various tasks and adapt to different conditions? A potential solution is to endow robots with learning capabilities. In this line, imitation learning emerges as an intuitive way to teach robots different motor skills. This learning approach typically mimics human demonstrations by extracting invariant motion patterns and subsequently applies these patterns to new situations. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel treatment of imitation learning, which endows the robot with imitative and adaptive capabilities. In particular, due to the kernel treatment, the proposed approach is capable of learning human skills associated with high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, we study a new concept of correlation-adaptive imitation learning, which allows for the adaptation of correlations exhibited in high-dimensional demonstrated skills. Several toy examples and a collaborative task with a real robot are provided to verify the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - Contact destabilization after an impact that occurs at high-speed, e.g. when a robot steps on an obstacle of unknown height, can be tackled by injecting angular momentum damping for a short time interval immediately after the impact. This is done by making use of the motion from within the reaction null-space (RNS). The angular momentum damping results in an appropriate arm motion that stabilizes the contacts. An impact at high-speed occurs when the stepping time is very short. In this case, conventional controllers cannot handle the reaction stemming from the swing leg dynamics. A general whole-body controller is designed that makes use of the relative angular acceleration control component to inject the angular momentum damping. The proposed control method is robust; it can deal with obstacles of various height and inclination without altering the feedback gains. The controller is fast since iterative optimization is avoided. The performance is examined via a simulated dynamic stepping.

AB  - Humanoid robots dynamically navigate an environment by interacting with it via contact wrenches exerted at intermittent contact poses. Therefore, it is important to consider dynamics when planning a contact sequence. Traditional contact planning approaches assume a quasi-static balance criterion to reduce the computational challenges of selecting a contact sequence over a rough terrain. This however limits the applicability of the approach when dynamic motions are required, such as when walking down a steep slope or crossing a wide gap. Recent methods overcome this limitation with the help of efficient mixed integer convex programming solvers capable of synthesizing dynamic contact sequences. Nevertheless, its exponential-time complexity limits its applicability to short time horizon contact sequences within small environments. In this paper, we go beyond current approaches by learning a prediction of the dynamic evolution of the robot centroidal momenta, which can then be used for quickly generating dynamically robust contact sequences for robots with arms and legs using a search-based contact planner. We demonstrate the efficiency and quality of the results of the proposed approach in a set of dynamically challenging scenarios.

AB  - We present a new framework to generate human-like lower-limb trajectories in periodic and non-periodic walking. In our method, walking dynamics is encoded in 3LP, a linear simplified model composed of three pendulums to simulate falling, swing, and torso balancing dynamics. To stabilize the motion, we use an optimal time-projecting controller which suggests new footstep locations. On top of gait generation and stabilization in the simplified space, we introduce a kinematic conversion that synthesizes more humanlike trajectories by combining geometric variables of the 3LP model adaptively. Without any tuning, numerical optimization or off-line data, our walking gaits are scalable with respect to body properties and gait parameters. We can change body mass and height, walking direction, speed, frequency, double support time, torso style, ground clearance, and terrain inclinations. We can also simulate constant external dragging forces or momentary perturbations. The proposed framework offers closed-form solutions with simulation speeds orders of magnitude faster than real time. This can be used for video games and animations on portable electronic devices with limited power. It also gives insights for generation of more human-like walking gaits on humanoid robots.

AB  - This paper presents Flying STAR (FSTAR) a reconfigurable hybrid flying quadcopter robot. FSTAR is the latest in the family of the STAR robots fitted with a sprawling mechanism and propellers allowing it to both run and fly using the same motors. The combined capabilities of running and flying allows FSTAR to fly over obstacles or run underneath them and move inside pipes. The robot can reduce its width to crawl in confined spaces or underneath obstacles while touching the ground. We first describe the design of the robot and the configuration of the wheels and propellers in the flying and running modes. Then we present the 3D printed prototype of the FSTAR robot which we used for our experiments. We evaluate the energy requirements of the robot and the forces it can generate. The experimental robot can fly like an ordinary quadcopter but can also run on the ground at a speed of up to 2.6 m/s to save energy (see video).

AB  - In this paper, a method for online parameter estimation and automatic control of a system of rigidly attached quadcopters is introduced. First, the method performs an estimation of the physical structure attaching the quadcopters by relying solely on information from the quadcopters' Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). This information is obtained via simple and short online experiments, allowing their plug and play assembly without any human intervention. Then, given the estimated physical attachment's parameters, a stable operation of the quadcopters is achieved via an adaptive controller architecture, where the controller parameters are obtained using Reinforcement Learning. Finally, experimental results validate the proposed method, showing that a correct estimation of the physical structure is obtained allowing the autonomous flight of a pair of attached quadcopters.

AB  - This paper presents a novel actuation model and control allocation strategy for a redundantly-actuated multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), referred to as the omnicopter. With an unconventional configuration, the omnicopter's eight propellers are able to produce all the six components of net force/torque, with two degrees of actuation redundancy. This enables the vehicle to execute motion trajectories unattainable with conventional underactuated multi-rotors. A new inverse actuator model is proposed that accounts for the significant interactions between propeller airflows by relating their output thrust forces to their input motor commands. Actuation redundancy is resolved by solving a convex constrained optimization problem. Its solution yields the most power efficient set of propellers thrusts that would produce a required net force/torque, while respecting the propeller thrust limits. When the required force/torque is infeasible due to the thrust limits, the solution would minimize the norm of the error between the desired and actual net force/torque vectors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and control allocation strategy.

AB  - High risk of a collision between rotor blades and the obstacles in a complex environment imposes restrictions on the aerial manipulators. To solve this issue, a novel system cable-Suspended Aerial Manipulator (SAM) is presented in this paper. Instead of attaching a robotic manipulator directly to an aerial carrier, it is mounted on an active platform which is suspended on the carrier by means of a cable. As a result, higher safety can be achieved because the aerial carrier can keep a distance from the obstacles. For self-stabilization, the SAM is equipped with two actuation systems: winches and propulsion units. This paper presents an overview of the SAM including the concept behind, hardware realization, control strategy, and the first experimental results.

Our open-source release includes all of the design documents, software resources, and simulation tools needed to build and fly a high-performance tail-sitter for research and educational purposes.The drone has been developed for precision flight with a high degree of control authority. Our design methodology included extensive testing and characterization of the aerodynamic properties of the vehicle. The platform incorporates many off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts, in order to keep the cost down. Nonetheless, the paper includes results from flight trials which demonstrate that the vehicle is capable of very stable hovering and accurate trajectory tracking.Our hope is that the open-source Phoenix reference design will be useful to both researchers and educators. In particular, the details in this paper and the available open-source materials should enable learners to gain an understanding of aerodynamics, flight control, state estimation, software design, and simulation, while experimenting with a unique aerial robot.

AB  - This paper presents a nonprehensile manipulation based on the vibration of a plate, in which three degrees of freedom (DoF) of a planar part are controlled using only one actuator. First, the model of a manipulator with a flat plate end effector is proposed. The manipulator employs an underactuated mechanism including an active joint and multiple passive viscoelastic joints, in which the joint axes are arranged nonparallel to each other. Based on the model, the orbit of the plate for a sinusoidal displacement input to the active joint is theoretically derived. It is revealed that not only the orbital shape but also the orbital direction can be varied according to the input frequency. Based on the switching frequency of the orbital direction, a design index for the mechanical parameters is shown. Subsequently, the contribution of the switching of the orbital direction to the three-DoF manipulation of a part is explored via simulation. Eight primitives utilizing the plate orbital motions in both counter-clockwise and clockwise directions are provided. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments.

AB  - This paper investigates the curve path following problem for a class of planar underactuated bio-inspired snake robots. The time-varying line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and the cubic spline interpolation (CSI) path-planning method are employed. Existing studies focus on straight line path following which only gives a solution for snake robot motion control in relatively simple environments. Considering the snake robot's many degrees of freedom and excellent mobility in terrains, we propose a more applicable solution of curve path following for snake robots on the ground. The improved LOS helps the snake robot to steer aggressively at a sharp turning point. Furthermore, to avoid the sideslip of the snake robot caused by the ground friction change, an integral controller is introduced in the design of the heading reference. Simulations and experiments on an 8-link custom-built snake robot are conducted and the results demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed curve path following algorithm.

AB  - Twisted string actuators are an emerging type of transmission systems that may benefit various applications of robotics and mechatronics. However, control of TSAs in applications that require high bandwidth has attracted comparatively little interest from research community, mainly due to complexity of twisted string behavior. This paper proposes a new adaptive control methodology that allows to sufficiently increase bandwidth of TSA-based systems. We reformulate mathematical model of the TSA into a suitable form for online parameter estimation, outline adaptive estimation methods and propose a method to design variable controller gain that rectifies nonlinearities in the system. we present experimental comparison of proposed adaptive control strategies with two conventional tsa control techniques. experimental results demonstrated that the proposed adaptive control architecture with feedforward speed term was nearly insensitive to increase in input signal frequency while reducing position tracking error by 80%. proposed algorithm can be applied in any tsa control system that has input and output signal measurements.

AB  - We describe the design and physical realization of a novel branching continuum robot, aimed at inspection and cleaning operations in hard-to-reach environments at depths greater than human arm lengths. The design, based on a hybrid concentric-tube/tendon actuated continuum trunk core, features two pairs of fully retractable continuum branches. The retractable nature of the branches allows the robot to actively change its topology, allowing it to penetrate narrow openings and expand to adaptively engage complex environmental geometries. We detail and discuss the realization of a physical prototype of the design, and its testing in a simulated glove box environment.

AB  - It is well known that sensors using strain gauges have a potential dependency on temperature. This creates temperature drift in the measurements of six axis force torque sensors (F/T). The temperature drift can be considerable if an experiment is long or the environmental conditions are different from when the calibration of the sensor was performed. Other in situ methods disregard the effect of temperature on the sensor measurements. Experiments performed using the humanoid robot platform iCub show that the effect of temperature is relevant. The model based in situ calibration of six axis force torque sensors method is extended to perform temperature compensation.

AB  - Humanoid robots are expected to interact in human environments, where physical interactions are unavoidable. Therefore, whole-body control methods that include multi-contact interactions are required. The new emerging technologies in touch sensing are fundamental to acquire online and rich information about these physical interactions with the environment. These technologies lead to the design of novel control systems that can profit from the tactile sensor information in an efficient form, thus producing reactive and compliant robots capable of interacting with their environment. In this paper, we present a novel control framework to integrate the multi-modal tactile information of a robot skin with different control strategies, producing dynamic behaviours suitable for Human-Robot Interactions (HRI). The control framework was experimentally evaluated on a full-size humanoid robot covered with more than 1260 skin cells distributed in the whole robot body. The results show that multi-modal tactile information can be fused hierarchically with multiple control strategies, producing active compliance in a position-controlled stiff humanoid robot.

AB  - Robots operating in unstructured environments would benefit from soft whole-body tactile sensors, but implementing such systems typically requires complex electrical wiring to a large number of sensing elements. The reconstruction method called electrical resistance tomography (ERT) has shown promising results (good coverage, manufacturability, and robustness) using electrodes located only along the boundary of the sensing region. However, relatively poor spatial resolution in the sensor's central region is a major drawback of the ERT approach. This paper introduces a new scheme of internal array electrodes to improve spatial resolution. We also systematically derive the optimal pairwise current injection patterns from a mathematical formulation of the ERT system. By highlighting the importance of each electrode pair, this approach enabled us to reduce the number of current injection patterns. Simulation of the standard and proposed sensor designs revealed that the internal array electrodes greatly improve distinguishability in the central region. For validation, a fabric-based soft tactile sensor made of multiple conductive fabrics was developed, including electronics that enable sampling at 200 Hz. During a 225-point localization test conducted without sensor-specific calibration, the constructed sensor showed average localization errors of 2.85 cm ± 1.02 cm. This result is notable because only 16 point electrodes were used to achieve this performance.

The sensor is vision-based and uses an array of markers to track deformations on a gel pad due to contact. A new hardware design makes the sensor more rugged, parametrically adjusTable AND Improves illumination. leveraging the sensor's increased functionality, we propose to use inverse finite element method (ifem), a numerical method to reconstruct the contact force distribution based on marker displacements. the sensor is able to provide force distribution of contact with high spatial density. experiments and comparison with ground truth show that the reconstructed force distribution is physically reasonable with good accuracy.A sequence of Kendama manipulations with corresponding displacement field (yellow) and force field (red).

AB  - Unsupervised Learning based monocular visual odometry (VO) has lately drawn significant attention for its potential in label-free leaning ability and robustness to camera parameters and environmental variations. However, partially due to the lack of drift correction technique, these methods are still by far less accurate than geometric approaches for large-scale odometry estimation. In this paper, we propose to leverage graph optimization and loop closure detection to overcome limitations of unsupervised learning based monocular visual odometry. To this end, we propose a hybrid VO system which combines an unsupervised monocular VO called NeuralBundler with a pose graph optimization back-end. NeuralBundler is a neural network architecture that uses temporal and spatial photometric loss as main supervision and generates a windowed pose graph consists of multi-view 6DoF constraints. We propose a novel pose cycle consistency loss to relieve the tensions in the windowed pose graph, leading to improved performance and robustness. In the back-end, a global pose graph is built from local and loop 6DoF constraints estimated by NeuralBundler, and is optimized over SE(3). Empirical evaluation on the KITTI odometry dataset demonstrates that 1) NeuralBundler achieves state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised monocular VO estimation, and 2) our whole approach can achieve efficient loop closing and show favorable overall translational accuracy compared to established monocular SLAM systems.

AB  - Radar presents a promising alternative to lidar and vision in autonomous vehicle applications, able to detect objects at long range under a variety of weather conditions. However, distinguishing between occupied and free space from raw radar power returns is challenging due to complex interactions between sensor noise and occlusion. To counter this we propose to learn an Inverse Sensor Model (ISM) converting a raw radar scan to a grid map of occupancy probabilities using a deep neural network. Our network is selfsupervised using partial occupancy labels generated by lidar, allowing a robot to learn about world occupancy from past experience without human supervision. We evaluate our approach on five hours of data recorded in a dynamic urban environment. By accounting for the scene context of each grid cell our model is able to successfully segment the world into occupied and free space, outperforming standard CFAR filtering approaches. Additionally by incorporating heteroscedastic uncertainty into our model formulation, we are able to quantify the variance in the uncertainty throughout the sensor observation. Through this mechanism we are able to successfully identify regions of space that are likely to be occluded.

AB  - Efficient exploration through unknown environments remains a challenging problem for robotic systems. In these situations, the robot's ability to reason about its future motion is often severely limited by sensor field of view (FOV). By contrast, biological systems routinely make decisions by taking into consideration what might exist beyond their FOV based on prior experience. We present an approach for predicting occupancy map representations of sensor data for future robot motions using deep neural networks. We develop a custom loss function used to make accurate prediction while emphasizing physical boundaries. We further study extensions to our neural network architecture to account for uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in mapping and exploration. Finally, we demonstrate a combined map prediction and information-theoretic exploration strategy using the variance of the generated hypotheses as the heuristic for efficient exploration of unknown environments.

AB  - In this paper we present an end-to-end deep learning framework to turn images that show dynamic content, such as vehicles or pedestrians, into realistic static frames. This objective encounters two main challenges: detecting all the dynamic objects, and inpainting the static occluded background with plausible imagery. The former challenge is addressed by the use of a convolutional network that learns a multiclass semantic segmentation of the image. The second problem is approached with a conditional generative adversarial model that, taking as input the original dynamic image and its dynamic/static binary mask, is capable of generating the final static image. These generated images can be used for applications such as augmented reality or vision-based robot localization purposes. To validate our approach, we show both qualitative and quantitative comparisons against other state-of-the-art inpainting methods by removing the dynamic objects and hallucinating the static structure behind them. Furthermore, to demonstrate the potential of our results, we carry out pilot experiments that show the benefits of our proposal for visual place recognition.

AB  - We propose a greedy and supervised learning approach for visibility-based exploration, reconstruction and surveillance. Using a level set representation, we train a convolutional neural network to determine vantage points that maximize visibility. We show that this method drastically reduces the on-line computational cost and determines a small set of vantage points that solve the problem. This enables us to efficiently produce highly-resolved and topologically accurate maps of complex 3D environments. Unlike traditional next-best-view and frontier-based strategies, the proposed method accounts for geometric priors while evaluating potential vantage points. While existing deep learning approaches focus on obstacle avoidance and local navigation, our method aims at finding near-optimal solutions to the more global exploration problem. We present realistic simulations on 2D and 3D urban environments.

AB  - In the last decade, supervised deep learning approaches have been extensively employed in visual odometry (VO) applications, which is not feasible in environments where labelled data is not abundant. On the other hand, unsupervised deep learning approaches for localization and mapping in unknown environments from unlabelled data have received comparatively less attention in VO research. In this study, we propose a generative unsupervised learning framework that predicts 6-DoF pose camera motion and monocular depth map of the scene from unlabelled RGB image sequences, using deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We create a supervisory signal by warping view sequences and assigning the re-projection minimization to the objective loss function that is adopted in multi-view pose estimation and single-view depth generation network. Detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed framework on the KITTI [1] and Cityscapes [2] datasets show that the proposed method outperforms both existing traditional and unsupervised deep VO methods providing better results for both pose estimation and depth recovery.

AB  - Semantic scene understanding is important for autonomous robots that aim to navigate dynamic environments, manipulate objects, or interact with humans in a natural way. In this paper, we address the problem of jointly performing semantic segmentation as well as instance segmentation in an online fashion, so that autonomous robots can use this information on-the-go and without sacrificing accuracy. We achieve this by exploiting a local connectivity prior of objects in the real world and a multi-task convolutional neural network architecture. The network identifies the individual object instances and their classes without region proposals or pre-segmentation of the images into individual classes. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our approach, and our experiments suggest that our method can be used to accurately segment instance masks of objects and identify their class in an online fashion.

AB  - In this paper we propose an approach to embed multi-dimensional continuous cues in binary feature descriptors used for visual place recognition. The embedding is achieved by extending each feature descriptor with a binary string that encodes a cue and supports the Hamming distance metric. Augmenting the descriptors in such a way has the advantage of being transparent to the procedure used to compare them. We present a concrete application of our methodology, demonstrating the considered type of continuous cue. Additionally, we conducted a broad quantitative and comparative evaluation on that application, covering five benchmark datasets and several state-of-the-art image retrieval approaches in combination with various binary descriptor types.

AB  - This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for classification of evolving targets, leveraging the principles of recursive Bayesian estimation in a perception-oriented context. By implementing a Gaussian toroid prediction model of the perception target's evolution, the proposed recursive Bayesian classification (RBC) scheme provides probabilistically robust classification. Appropriate features are extracted from the target, which is then probabilistically represented in a belief space. This approach is capable of handling high-dimensional belief spaces, while simultaneously allowing for multi-Gaussian representation of belief without computational complexity that hinders real-time analysis. The proposed technique is validated over several parameter values by thousands of simulated experiments, where it is shown to outperform naıve classification when high observational uncertainty is present.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of object discovery from unlabeled driving videos captured in a realistic automotive setting. Identifying recurring object categories in such raw video streams is a very challenging problem. Not only do object candidates first have to be localized in the input images, but many interesting object categories occur relatively infrequently. Object discovery will therefore have to deal with the difficulties of operating in the long tail of the object distribution. We demonstrate the feasibility of performing fully automatic object discovery in such a setting by mining object tracks using a generic object tracker. In order to facilitate further research in objet discovery, we release a collection of more than 360,000 automatically mined object tracks from 10 + hours of video data (560,000 frames). We use this dataset to evaluate the suitability of different feature representations and clustering strategies for object discovery.

AB  - We formulate a new problem as Object Importance Estimation (OIE) in on-road driving videos, where the road users are considered as important objects if they have influence on the control decision of the ego-vehicle's driver. The importance of a road user depends on both its visual dynamics, e.g., appearance, motion and location, in the driving scene and the driving goal, e.g., the planned path, of the ego vehicle. We propose a novel framework that incorporates both visual model and goal representation to conduct OIE. To evaluate our framework, we collect an on-road driving dataset at traffic intersections in the real world and conduct human-labeled annotation of the important objects. Experimental results show that our goal-oriented method outperforms baselines and has much more improvement on the left-turn and right-turn scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of using object importance for driving control prediction and demonstrate that binary brake prediction can be improved with the information of object importance.

AB  - We investigate the role of geometric context in deep neural networks to establish better pedestrian detectors that are more robust to occlusions. Notwithstanding their demonstrated successes, deep object detectors under-perform in crowded scenes with high intra-category occlusions. One brute-force solution is to collect a large number of labeled training samples under occlusion, but the combinatorial increase in the labeling effort makes it an unaffordable solution. We argue that a promising and complementary direction to solve this problem is to bring geometric context to modulate feature learning in a DNN. We identify that an effective way to leverage geometric context is to induce it in two steps - through early fusion, by guiding region proposal generation to focus on occluded regions, and through late fusion, by penalizing misalignments of bounding boxes in both 2D and 3D. Our experiments on multiple state-of-the-art DNN detectors and detection benchmarks clearly demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms strong baselines by an average of 5%.

AB  - The stochastic Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP), which finds application in robot route selection under uncertainty, aims to find the traversal policy with the minimum expected cost. This paper extends the CTP to what we call the Robust Canadian Traveler Problem (RCTP), in which the variability of the policy cost is also part of the evaluation criteria. An optimal (offline) algorithm and an approximate (online) algorithm are then proposed to compute the policy that has a good balance of both mean and variation of the traversal cost. The benefit of the proposed framework versus traditional approaches is shown by doing simulations in randomly generated worlds as well as on a map of 5 km of paths built from robot field trials. Specifically, the RCTP framework is able to search for sub-optimal policy alternatives with significantly lower worst-case cost and less computational time compared to the optimal policy, but with little sacrifice on the expected cost.

AB  - With node selection being directed by a heuristic cost [1]-[3], A-search guided tree (AGT) is constructed on-the-fly and enables fast kinodynamic planning. This work presents two variants of AGT to improve computation efficiency. An improved AGT (i-AGT) biases node expansion through prioritizing control actions, an analogy of prioritizing nodes. Focusing on node selection, a bi-directional AGT (BAGT) introduces a second tree originated from the goal in order to offer a better heuristic cost of the first tree. Effectiveness of BAGT pivots on the fact that the second tree encodes obstacles information near the goal. Case study demonstrates that i-AGT consistently reduces the complexity of the tree and improves computation efficiency; and BAGT works largely but not always, particularly with no benefit observed for simple cases.

AB  - Sampling efficiency in a highly constrained environment has long been a major challenge for sampling-based planners. In this work, we propose Rapidly-exploring Random disjointed-Trees* (RRdT*), an incremental optimal multi-query planner. RRdT* uses multiple disjointed-trees to exploit local-connectivity of spaces via Markov Chain random sampling, which utilises neighbourhood information derived from previous successful and failed samples. To balance local exploitation, RRdT* actively explore unseen global spaces when local-connectivity exploitation is unsuccessful. The active trade-off between local exploitation and global exploration is formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem. We argue that the active balancing of global exploration and local exploitation is the key to improving sample efficient in sampling-based motion planners. We provide rigorous proofs of completeness and optimal convergence for this novel approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of RRdT*'s locally exploring trees in granting improved visibility for planning. Consequently, RRdT* outperforms existing state-of-the-art incremental planners, especially in highly constrained environments.

AB  - Locomotion planning for legged systems requires reasoning about suitable contact schedules. The contact sequence and timings constitute a hybrid dynamical system and prescribe a subset of achievable motions. State-of-the-art approaches cast motion planning as an optimal control problem. In order to decrease computational complexity, one common strategy separates footstep planning from motion optimization and plans contacts using heuristics. In this paper, we propose to learn contact schedule selection from high-level task descriptors using Bayesian Optimization. A bi-level optimization is defined in which a Gaussian Process model predicts the performance of trajectories generated by a motion planning nonlinear program. The agent, therefore, retains the ability to reason about suitable contact schedules, while explicit computation of the corresponding gradients is avoided. We delineate the algorithm in its general form and provide results for planning single-legged hopping. Our method is capable of learning contact schedule transitions that align with human intuition. It performs competitively against a heuristic baseline in predicting task appropriate contact schedules.

AB  - Real-time navigation in dense human environments is a challenging problem in robotics. Most existing path planners fail to account for the dynamics of pedestrians because introducing time as an additional dimension in search space is computationally prohibitive. Alternatively, most local motion planners only address imminent collision avoidance and fail to offer long-term optimality. In this work, we present an approach, called Dynamic Channels, to solve this global to local quandary. Our method combines the high-level topological path planning with low-level motion planning into a complete pipeline. By formulating the path planning problem as graph-searching in the triangulation space, our planner is able to explicitly reason about the obstacle dynamics and capture the environmental change efficiently. We evaluate efficiency and performance of our approach on public pedestrian datasets and compare it to a state-of-the-art planning algorithm for dynamic obstacle avoidance. Completeness proofs are provided in the supplement at http://caochao.me/files/proof.pdf. An extended version of the paper is available on arXiv.

AB  - This paper suggests reflections can be practically useful if they are included in planning for collision capable robot platforms. By modifying a proven strategy for navigation with reflections we maintain global convergence results and reach the goal in less time. An algorithm for identifying reflection surfaces for a given cell decomposition is reported. Baseline and reflected scenarios are compared for two different cell decompositions. Omnipuck, a reflection capable omnidirectional robot meant to store and release impact energy, is used to obtain experimental results and draw conclusions for future work.

AB  - By modeling the system with the mechanical, electrical, and magnetic field, we can derive the system equation for the actuator modeling. As it is not easy to conclude the output signal from the equations, we used Simulink to simulate and check the performance aspect of the system. After that, we did several experiments to verify whether experimental force meets with the needed condition for impact hot embossing and matches with simulation force. We tried to adjust the parameters of the system to match the force of experiment result and that of the simulation result. From the comparison, we can consider the analysis of the actuator as precise. A successful study can contribute to the better application of new type hot embossing techniques and better understanding and usage of the electromagnetic actuator when it is applied to another technology and research.

AB  - Surface finishing of freeform surfaces is predominately a manual operation that requires a considerable amount of operator skill; automation of this process has many benefits, including consistent surface quality, preventing hazardous exposure to particulate, etc. A novel robotic surface finishing system, consisting of a robot and an end-effector that includes a force sensor, finishing tool, and proximity laser sensor, is developed in this paper to automate the surface finishing process. The laser sensor is treated as an additional link, and based on it a novel perception system is developed for real-time scanning of the surface that provides the surface profile mesh and the corresponding normal vectors which can be used directly by the robot closed-loop control system for pose tracking. A unique feature of the perception system is that the geometry of the surface profile and normal vectors are all obtained in real-time in the robot base coordinate system, thus eliminating issues such as precise registration of the work piece in the fixture and its location with respect to the robot base coordinates. An impedance-type closed-loop control algorithm is developed for pose tracking. The proposed system and control algorithm are employed to conduct surface finishing experiments on wooden surfaces. A representative sample of the results and measurement images of surface finish are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the robotic surface finishing system. A video of the system in operation is also provided.

AB  - Currently, automatically generated trajectories cannot be directly used on tasks that require high execution accuracies due to errors accused by inaccuracies in the robot model, actuator errors, and controller limitations. These trajectories often need manual refinement. This is not economically viable on low production volume applications. Unfortunately, execution errors are dependent on the nature of the trajectory and end-effector loads, and therefore devising a general purpose automated compensation scheme for reducing trajectory errors is not possible. This paper presents a method for analyzing the given trajectory, executing an exploratory physical run for a small portion of the given trajectory, and learning a compensation scheme based on the measured data. The learned compensation scheme is context-dependent and can be used to reduce the execution error. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by conducting physical experiments.

AB  - Successfully completing a complex manufacturing task requires finding a feasible placement of the workpiece in the robot workspace. The workpiece placement should be such that the task surfaces on the workpiece are reachable by the robot, the robot can apply the required forces, and the end-effector/tool can move with the desired velocity. This paper formulates the problem of identifying a feasible placement as a non-linear optimization problem over the constraint violation functions. This is a computationally challenging problem. We show that this problem can be solved by successively searching for the solution by incrementally applying different constraints. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using several complex workpieces.

AB  - We propose a geometric method to solve inverse kinematics (IK) problems of 7-DoF manipulators with joint offsets at shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Traditionally, inverse position kinematics for redundant manipulators are solved by using an iterative method based on the pseudo-inverse of the manipulator Jacobian. This provides a single solution among the infinitely many possible solutions for the IK problem of redundant manipulators. There are no closed-form IK solutions for redundant manipulators with multiple joint offsets. Using our method we can compute multiple IK solutions using two-parameter search by exploiting geometry of the structure of a redundant manipulator. Our proposed IK algorithm can handle multiple joint offsets and is mathematically simple to implement in a few lines of code. We apply our algorithm to compute IK solutions for 7-DoF redundant Baxter robot (that has joint offsets at shoulder, wrist, and elbow joints) for end-effector configurations where existing geometry-based IK solvers fail to find solutions. We also demonstrate the use of our algorithm in an application where we want to compute an IK solution (among the infinitely many possible solutions) that has minimum error bound in end-effector position, in the presence of random joint actuation and sensing uncertainties.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles apply pertinent planning and control algorithms under different driving conditions. The mode switch between these algorithms should also be autonomous. On top of the nominal planners, a safe fallback routine is needed to stop the vehicle at a safe position if nominal operational conditions are violated, such as for a system failure. This paper describes the design and formal verification of a supervisor to manage all requirements for mode switching between nominal planners, and additional requirements for switching to a safe stop trajectory planner that acts as the fallback routine. The supervisor is designed via a model-based approach and its abstraction is formally verified by model checking. The supervisor is implemented and integrated with the Research Concept Vehicle, an experimental research and demonstration vehicle developed at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Simulations and experiments show that the vehicle is able to autonomously drive in a safe manner between two parking lots and can successfully come to a safe stop upon GPS sensor failure.

AB  - Accurate environment representation is one of the key challenges in autonomous ground vehicle navigation in unstructured environments. We propose a real-time optimization-based approach to terrain modeling and path planning in off-road and rough environments. Our method uses an irregular, hierarchical, graph-like environment model. A space-dividing tree is used to define a compact data structure capturing vertex positions and establishing connectivity. The same unique underlying data structure is used for both terrain modeling and path planning without memory reallocation. Local plans are generated by graph search algorithms and are continuously regenerated for on-the-fly obstacle avoidance inside the scope of the local terrain map. We show that implementing a hierarchical model over a regular space division reduces graph edge expansions by up to 84%. We illustrate the applicability of the method through experiments with an unmanned ground vehicle in both structured and unstructured environments.

AB  - We present a Pedestrian Dominance Model (PDM) to identify the dominance characteristics of pedestrians for robot navigation. Through a perception study on a simulated dataset of pedestrians, PDM models the perceived dominance levels of pedestrians with varying motion behaviors corresponding to trajectory, speed, and personal space. At runtime, we use PDM to identify the dominance levels of pedestrians to facilitate socially-aware navigation for the robots. PDM can predict dominance levels from trajectories with ~85% accuracy. Prior studies in psychology literature indicate that when interacting with humans, people are more comfortable around people that exhibit complementary movement behaviors. Our algorithm leverages this by enabling the robots to exhibit complementing responses to pedestrian dominance. We also present an application of PDM for generating dominance-based collision-avoidance behaviors in the navigation of autonomous vehicles among pedestrians. We demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm for robots navigating among tens of pedestrians in simulated environments.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of dynamic traffic scene classification under space-time variations in viewpoint that arise from video captured on-board a moving vehicle. Solutions to this problem are important for realization of effective driving assistance technologies required to interpret or predict road user behavior. Currently, dynamic traffic scene classification has not been adequately addressed due to a lack of benchmark datasets that consider spatiotemporal evolution of traffic scenes resulting from a vehicle's ego-motion. This paper has three main contributions. First, an annotated dataset is released to enable dynamic scene classification that includes 80 hours of diverse high quality driving video data clips collected in the San Francisco Bay area. The dataset includes temporal annotations for road places, road types, weather, and road surface conditions. Second, we introduce novel and baseline algorithms that utilize semantic context and temporal nature of the dataset for dynamic classification of road scenes. Finally, we showcase algorithms and experimental results that highlight how extracted features from scene classification serve as strong priors and help with tactical driver behavior understanding. The results show significant improvement from previously reported driving behavior detection baselines in the literature.

Still, the development of autonomous racing cars has been confined mainly to laboratory studies and small to middle scale vehicles. This paper tackles the development of a planning and control framework for an electric full scale autonomous racing car, which is an absolute novelty in the literature, upon which we report our preliminary experiments and perspectives on future work. Our system leverages real time Nonlinear Model Predictive Control to track a pre-planned racing line.

The proposed strategy is based on Extremum Seeking control and (a) does not require any model of the power consumption of the system, (b) can be executed on-line, and (c) guarantees adaptation to unknown disturbances. We show experimentally that hovering is not the most energy-efficient loitering strategy, and we demonstrate the proposed method's ability to adapt to different aerodynamic disturbances, such as payloads. The method may be especially useful in applications where a quadcopter carries an unknown payload, allowing it to adapt for improved range.

AB  - Reliable detection and reconstruction of wires is one of the hardest problems in the UAV community, with a wide ranging impact in the industry in terms of wire avoidance capabilities and powerline corridor inspection. In this work, we introduce a real-time, model-based, multi-view algorithm to reconstruct wires from a set of images with known camera poses, while exploiting their natural shape - the catenary curve. Using a model-based approach helps us deal with partial wire detections in images, which may occur due to natural occlusion and false negatives. In addition, using a parsimonious model makes our algorithm efficient as we only need to optimize for 5 model parameters, as opposed to hundreds of 3D points in bundle-adjustment approaches. Our algorithm obviates the need for pixel correspondences by computing the reprojection error via the distance transform of binarized wire segmentation images. Further, we make our algorithm robust to arbitrary initializations by introducing an on-demand, approximate extrapolation of the distance transform based objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm against false negatives and random initializations in simulation, and show qualitative results with real data collected from a small UAV.

AB  - This paper presents planning and control algorithms for a multi-rotor with a suspended load. The suspended load cannot be controlled easily by the multi-rotor due to severe dynamic coupling between them. Difficulties are exacerbated by under-actuated, highly nonlinear nature of multi-rotor dynamics. Although many studies have been proposed to plan trajectories and control this system, there exist only a few reports on real-time trajectory generation. With this in mind, we propose a planning method which is capable of generating collision-free trajectories real-time and applicable to a high-dimensional nonlinear system. Using a differential flatness property, the system can be linearized entirely with elaborately chosen flat outputs. Convexification of non-convex constraints is carried out, and concave obstacle-avoidance constraints are converted to convex ones. After that, a convex optimization problem is solved to generate an optimal trajectory, but semi-feasible trajectory which considers only some parts of the initial state. We apply model predictive control with a sequential linear quadratic solver to compute a feasible collision-free trajectory and to control the system. Performance of the algorithm is validated by flight experiment.

AB  - In this work we present a bioinspired visual system sensor to estimate angular rates in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) using Neural Networks. We have conceived a hardware setup to emulate Drosophila's ocellar system, three simple eyes related to stabilization. This device is composed of three low resolution cameras with a similar spatial configuration as the ocelli. There have been previous approaches based on this ocellar system, most of them considering assumptions such as known light source direction or a punctual light source. In contrast, here we present a learning approach using Artificial Neural Networks in order to recover the system's angular rates indoors and outdoors without previous knowledge. A classical computer vision based method is also derived to be used as a benchmark for the learning approach. The method is validated with a large dataset of images (more than half a million samples) including synthetic and real data. The source code of the algorithms and the datasets used in this paper have been released in an open repository.

AB  - The recent increase in the use of aerial vehicles raises concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous operations. There is a growing need for methods to monitor the status of these aircraft and report any faults and anomalies to the safety pilot or to the autopilot to deal with the emergency situation. In this paper, we present a real-time approach using the Recursive Least Squares method to detect anomalies in the behavior of an aircraft. The method models the relationship between correlated input-output pairs online and uses the model to detect the anomalies. The result is an easy-to-deploy anomaly detection method that does not assume a specific aircraft model and can detect many types of faults and anomalies in a wide range of autonomous aircraft. The experiments on this method show a precision of 88.23%, recall of 88.23% and 86.36% accuracy for over 22 flight tests. The other contribution is providing a new fault detection open dataset for autonomous aircraft, which contains complete data and the ground truth for 22 fixed-wing flights with eight different types of mid-flight actuator failures to help future fault detection research for aircraft.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an approach to learn compact representations from salient landmarks detected by a visual attention algorithm to recognize previously visited places in underwater environments. Instead of using hand-crafted local descriptors as it has been typically done in visual place recognition, we use a convolutional autoencoder to obtain an ad hoc descriptor generator from salient landmarks. The main advantage of using an autoencoder is that it can learn in an unsupervised manner directly from the salient landmarks. In addition, we show that it is possible to do the training with less than 100,000 examples instead of several hundreds of thousands or even millions of labeled examples as in other convolutional architectures. The trained convolutional autoencoder is used to obtain descriptors for salient landmarks that are later utilized in a voting scheme to calculate similarity between images with the objective of finding if a place has already been visited. The proposed method has obtained good results compared to SeqSLAM and FAB-MAP in different datasets obtained from robotic explorations of coral reefs in real life conditions. Moreover, when the visual attention algorithm is used, fewer features are required to get a good performance in terms of precision and recall compared when using the SURF method to extract visual features.

AB  - Robot-diver communication underwater is complicated by the attenuation of RF signals, the complexities of the environment in terms of deploying interaction devices, and issues related to the cognitive loading of human operators. Humans operating underwater have developed a simple yet effective strategy for diver-diver communication based on the visual recognition of gestures. Can a similar approach be effective for diver-robot communication? Here we present experiments with SCUBANet, an underwater detection dataset of body parts associated with diver-robot communication. Given the nature of standard diver gestures, here we concentrate on diver recognition and in particular on diver body-head-hand localization and examine the feasibility of using a CNN-based approach to address this problem. Such data-driven approaches typically require an appropriately annotated dataset. The SCUBANet dataset contains images of object classes commonly encountered during human-robot communication underwater. Object classes are labeled using per-instance bounding boxes. Annotations were created through crowd sourcing via a web-based interface to ease deployment. We provide baseline performance on diver and diver component recognition and localization using transfer learning on three widely available pre-trained models.

AB  - Trash deposits in aquatic environments have a destructive effect on marine ecosystems and pose a long-term economic and environmental threat. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) could very well contribute to the solution of this problem by finding and eventually removing trash. This paper evaluates a number of deep-learning algorithms performing the task of visually detecting trash in realistic underwater environments, with the eventual goal of exploration, mapping, and extraction of such debris by using AUVs. A large and publicly-available dataset of actual debris in open-water locations is annotated for training a number of convolutional neural network architectures for object detection. The trained networks are then evaluated on a set of images from other portions of that dataset, providing insight into approaches for developing the detection capabilities of an AUV for underwater trash removal. In addition, the evaluation is performed on three different platforms of varying processing power, which serves to assess these algorithms' fitness for real-time applications.

Flow-rate feedback is obtained using a custom flow sensor comprised of a differential pressure sensor and a small, 3D-printed attachment. The controller is simulated using a model of the CephaloBot, our in-house developed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Its depth control capability is also experimentally validated using a single-bladder buoyancy engine on-board a smaller-scale test cylinder. Lyapunov stability analysis shows global, asymptotic stability, which is exhibited in our simulation. Our experiments verify that this buoyancy engine is a feasible and effective depth controller for AUVs.

AB  - Although most robots use probabilistic algorithms to solve state estimation problems, path planning is often performed without considering the uncertainty about the robot's position. Uncertainty, however, matters in planning, but considering it often leads to computationally expensive algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the problem of path planning considering the uncertainty in the robot's belief about the world, in its perceptions and in its action execution. We propose the use of an uncertainty-augmented Markov Decision Process to approximate the underlying Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, and we employ a localization prior to estimate how the belief about the robot's position propagates through the environment. This yields to a planning approach that generates navigation policies able to make decisions according to the degree of uncertainty while being computationally tractable. We implemented our approach and thoroughly evaluated it on different navigation problems. Our experiments suggest that we are able to compute policies that are more effective than approaches that ignore the uncertainty, and that also outperform policies that always take the safest actions.

AB  - This work presents a model based traversability analysis method which employs a detailed vehicle model to perform real-time path planning in complex environments. The vehicle model represents the vehicle's wheels and chassis, allowing it to accurately predict the vehicles 3D pose, detailed contact information for each wheel and the occurrence of a chassis collision given a 2D pose on an elevation map. These predictions are weighted, depending on the safety requirements of the vehicle, to provide a scoring function for an A*-like search strategy. The proposed method is designed to run at frame rates of 30Hz on data from a RGB-D sensor to provide reactive planning of safe paths. For evaluation, two wheeled mobile robots in different simulated and real world environment setups were tested to show the reliability and performance of the proposed method.

AB  - This paper presents a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) that uses navigation integrity risk as a constraint. Navigation integrity risk accounts for the presence of faults in localization sensors and algorithms, an increasingly important consideration as the number of robots operating in life and mission-critical situations is expected to increase dramatically in near future (e.g. a potential influx of self-driving cars). Specifically, the work uses a local nearest neighbor integrity risk evaluation methodology that accounts for data association faults as a constraint in order to guarantee localization safety over a receding horizon. Moreover, state and control-input constraints have also been enforced in this work. The proposed MPC design is tested using real-world mapped environments, showing that a robot is capable of maintaining a predefined minimum level of localization safety while operating in an urban environment.

AB  - One of the challenges of developing autonomous vehicles is planning in an inhabited environment under sensing uncertainty as well as limited perception and computational resources. Besides reasoning about the behaviour of traffic participants that are within the vehicles' field of view, safe autonomous driving also requires the vehicle to reason about possible traffic participants that might exist beyond its sensing horizon, and to adapt its driving behaviour accordingly. This paper describes an inference and motion planning pipeline that is able to guarantee passive safety (collisions are possible, but the autonomous vehicle will be at rest) with respect to hypothetical hidden agents that have not been observed yet. We also incorporate the vehicle's reaction time due to sensing and computational delays into the planning process; for example, we show how having a fast reaction time due to the availability of more computational resources leads to more aggressive trajectories, while a car with a larger reaction time will choose more relaxed trajectories that require less attention.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the problem of navigating cluttered environments without explicit object detection and tracking. We introduce the dynamic risk density to map the congestion density and spatial flow of the environment to a cost function for the agent to determine risk when navigating that environment. We build upon our prior work, wherein the agent maps the density and motion of objects to an occupancy risk, then navigate the environment over a specified risk level set. Here, the agent does not need to identify objects to compute the occupancy risk, and instead computes this cost function using the occupancy density and velocity fields around them. Simulations show how this dynamic risk density encodes movement information for the ego agent and closely models the object-based congestion cost. We implement our dynamic risk density on an autonomous wheelchair and show how it can be used for navigating unstructured, crowded and cluttered environments.

AB  - We present a navigation system that combines ideas from hierarchical planning and machine learning. The system uses a traditional global planner to compute optimal paths towards a goal, and a deep local trajectory planner and velocity controller to compute motion commands. The latter components of the system adjust the behavior of the robot through attention mechanisms such that it moves towards the goal, avoids obstacles, and respects the space of nearby pedestrians. Both the structure of the proposed deep models and the use of attention mechanisms make the system's execution interpretable. Our simulation experiments suggest that the proposed architecture outperforms baselines that try to map global plan information and sensor data directly to velocity commands. In comparison to a hand-designed traditional navigation system, the proposed approach showed more consistent performance.

AB  - In this work, we investigate a mechanics-inspired framework for describing fingertip-based planar within-hand manipulation with an underactuated robotic gripper. In particular, this framework leverages fundamental mechanics properties of the hand-object system, including basic terms such as local contact curvature as well as more complex features including the grasp matrix and manipulability metrics. These are extracted using a simple visual approach and then in real-time used for predicting planar manipulation modes: namely rolling, dropped, stuck, and sliding. Given a desired cartesian motion for the object, a supervised learning model predicts these four manipulation modes before they occur, allowing us to either avoid or trigger these different behaviors. Since we utilize strictly fundamental properties of the grasp matrix, finger Jacobians, and contact curvatures, we are able to demonstrate prediction transferability between different grippers using our original classifier. In particular, a Random Forests classifier trained on one gripper successfully predicts manipulation modes for grippers with different fingers with 84% accuracy, compared to just 56% from an approach in previous work. Overall, we find that the features designed in our approach better describes fingertip manipulation when precise gripper models are not available.

AB  - Future robotic assembly systems will allow product designers to upload their assembled product models remotely such that they can be assembled autonomously. In this work we present the architecture for a Click and Assemble Robotic Assembly (CARA) system. This architecture takes an assembly file uploaded by the user through a web interface as the only input. It then performs all the necessary planning before executing the assembly. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that all of the required components from previous advances in robotic assembly have been brought together, with all interconnecting challenges solved, into a complete working system for physical, real world assembly tasks. To demonstrate the implemented architecture capabilities, a real industrial product with tight tolerances was assembled from its CAD file only, illustrating the end to end robotic assembly premise in a real world setting.

AB  - MacGyvering is defined as creating or repairing something in an inventive or improvised way by utilizing objects that are available at hand. In this paper, we explore a subset of Macgyvering problems involving tool construction, i.e., creating tools from parts available in the environment. We formalize the overall problem domain of tool Macgyvering, introducing three levels of complexity for tool construction and substitution problems, and presenting a novel computational framework aimed at solving one level of the tool Macgyvering problem, specifically contributing a novel algorithm for tool construction based on geometric reasoning. We validate our approach by constructing three tools using a 7-DOF robot arm.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a novel framework for expressing and learning force-sensitive robot manipulation skills. It is based on a formalism that extends our previous work on adaptive impedance control with meta parameter learning and compatible skill specifications. This way the system is also able to make use of abstract expert knowledge by incorporating process descriptions and quality evaluation metrics. We evaluate various state-of-the-art schemes for meta parameter learning and experimentally compare selected ones. Our results clearly indicate that the combination of our adaptive impedance controller with a carefully defined skill formalism significantly reduces the complexity of manipulation tasks even for learning peg-in-hole with submillimeter industrial tolerances. Overall, the considered system is able to learn variations of this skill in under 20 minutes. In fact, experimentally the system was able to perform the learned tasks without visual feedback faster than humans, leading to the first learning-based solution of complex assembly at such real-world performance.

AB  - We propose a novel scheme that jointly addresses the problems of powering and coordinating a population of mini-robots for collective construction. In our setting, a population of simple mobile robots must push blocks into desired polygonal shapes. Each robot performs only simple phototaxis. Coordination is purely open-loop: a global light field guides and powers the robots. We demonstrate this concept in simulation and explore a series of dynamic light field design strategies that robustly result in assembled shapes including nonconvex polygons.
