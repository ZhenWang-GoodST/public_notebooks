AB  - We develop a Deep Learning-based Wearable Vision-system with Vibrotactile-feedback (DLWV2)to guide Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI)people to reach objects. The system achieves high accuracy in object detection and tracking in 3-D using an extended deep learning-based 2.5-D detector and a 3-D object tracker with the ability to track 3-D object locations even outside the camera field-of-view. We train our detector with a large number of images with 2.5-D object ground-truth (i.e., 2-D object bounding boxes and distance from the camera to objects). A novel combination of HTC Vive Tracker with our system enables us to automatically obtain the ground-truth labels for training while requiring very little human effort to set up the system. Moreover, our system processes frames in real-time through a client-server computing platform such that BVI people can receive realtime vibrotactile guidance. We conduct a thorough user study on 12 BVI people in new environments with object instances which are unseen during training. Our system outperforms the non-assistive guiding strategy with statistic significance in both time and the number of contacting irrelevant objects. Finally, the interview with BVI users confirms that our system with distance-based vibrotactile feedback is mostly preferred, especially for objects requiring gentle manipulation such as a bottle with water inside.

AB  - Point cloud registration is a popular research topic and has been widely used in many tasks, such as robot mapping and localization. It is a challenging problem when the overlap is small, or the rotation is large. The problem has not been well solved by existing methods such as the iterative closest point (ICP) and its variants. In this paper, a novel method named principal coordinate alignment with overlap tuning (PCAOT) is proposed based on the Manhattan world assumption. It solves two key problems together, the transformation estimation and the overlap estimation. The overlap is represented by a 3D cuboid and the transformation is computed only within the overlap region. Instead of finding point correspondence as in traditional methods, we estimate the rotation by principal coordinates alignment, which is faster and less sensitive than ICP and its variants to small overlaps and large rotations. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves much better results than the ICP and its variants when the overlap ratio is smaller than 50%, or the rotation angle is larger than 60°. Especially, it is effective when the overlap ratio is less than 30%, or the rotation angle is larger than 90°.

AB  - With the advent of polygonal maps finding their way into the navigational software of mobile robots, the Visibility Graph can be used to search for the shortest collision-free path. The nature of the Visibility Graph-based shortest path algorithms is such that first the entire graph is computed in a relatively time-consuming manner. Then, the graph can be searched efficiently any number of times for varying start and target state combinations with the A* or the Dijkstra algorithm. However, real-world environments are typically too dynamic for a map to remain valid for a long time. With the goal of obtaining the shortest path quickly in an ever changing environment, we introduce a rapid path finding algorithm-Minimal Construct-that discovers only a necessary portion of the Visibility Graph around the obstacles that actually get in the way. Collision tests are computed only for lines that seem heuristically promising. This way, shortest paths can be found much faster than with a state-of-the-art Visibility Graph algorithm and as our experiments show, even grid-based A* searches are outperformed in most cases with the added benefit of smoother and shorter paths.

AB  - We describe a trajectory planning method for heterogeneous mobile robot teams in known environments. We consider two core problems that arise with heterogeneous robot teams: asymmetric inter-robot collision constraints and varying dynamic limits. Asymmetric collision constraints are important for close-proximity flight of rotorcraft due to the downwash effect, which complicates spatial coordination. Varying dynamic limits complicate temporal coordination between robots and must be taken into account during planning. Our method builds upon a hybrid planner that combines graph-planning techniques with trajectory optimization and scales well to large homogeneous robot teams. We extend the hybrid planning approach to include the additional spatial and temporal coordination to support heterogeneous teams. Our method scales well with the number of robots and robot types and we demonstrate our approach on a team of 15 physical robots of 4 different types, including quadrotors and differential drive robots.

AB  - This paper outlines an algorithmic approach for the automatic coordination and planning of heterogeneous multi-robot teams. Specifically, this work addresses the marsupial-based subset of multi-robot teams, where “carrier” robots transport and deploy “passenger” robots. The approach starts with a high-level watershed segmentation of the world to determine the free-space regions accessible by each robot in the team. Topological graph planning then decides the high-level motion plan for each robot between these free-space regions. Finally, a low-level path planner generates optimized, dynamically-feasible trajectories for each robot along the topological path. The performance of the approach is evaluated in simulation and through hardware experiments.

AB  - This paper is concerned with automating fleets of autonomous robots. This involves solving a multitude of problems, including goal assignment, motion planning, and coordination, while maximizing some performance criterion. While methods for solving these sub-problems have been studied, they address only a facet of the overall problem, and make strong assumptions on the use-case, on the environment, or on the robots in the fleet. In this paper, we formulate the overall fleet management problem in terms of Optimal Control. We describe a scheme for solving this problem in the particular case of fleets of non-holonomic robots navigating in an environment with obstacles. The method is based on a two-phase approach, whereby the first phase solves for fleet-wide boolean decision variables via Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming, and the second phase solves for real-valued variables to obtain an optimized set of trajectories for the fleet. Examples showcasing the features of the method are illustrated, and the method is validated experimentally.

AB  - As communication is important for cooperation, teams of mobile robots need a way to re-establish a wireless connection if they get separated. We develop a method for mobile robots to maintain a belief of each other's positions using locally available information. They can use their belief to plan paths with high probabilities of reconnection. This approach also works for subteams cooperatively searching for a robot or group of robots that they would like to reconnect with. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is solved using a branch-and-bound approach. We present simulation results showing the effectiveness of this strategy at reconnecting teams of up to five robots and compare the results to two other strategies.

AB  - This work presents a strategy for coordinated multi-agent weeding under conditions of partial environmental information. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of coordination strategies for improving the weeding performance of autonomous agricultural robots. We show that, given a sufficient number of agents, the algorithm can successfully weed fields with various initial seed bank densities, even when multiple days are allowed to elapse before weeding commences. Furthermore, the use of coordination between agents is demonstrated to strongly improve system performance as the number of agents increases, enabling the system to eliminate all the weeds in the field, as in the case of full environmental information, when the planner without coordination failed to do so. As a domain to test our algorithms, we have developed an open source simulation environment, Weed World, which allows real-time visualization of coordinated weeding policies, and includes realistic weed generation. In this work, experiments are conducted to determine the required number of agents and their required transit speed, for given initial seed bank densities and varying allowed days before the start of the weeding process.

AB  - We present the Intelligent Robotic IoT System (IRIS), a modular, portable, scalable, and open-source testbed for robotic wireless network research. There are two key features that separate IRIS from most of the state-of-the-art multi-robot testbeds. (1)Portability: IRIS does not require a costly static global positioning system such as a VICON system nor time-intensive vision-based SLAM for its operation. Designed with an inexpensive Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)localization system with centimeter level accuracy, the IRIS testbed can be deployed in an arbitrary uncontrolled environment in a matter of minutes. (2)Programmable Wireless Communication Stack: IRIS comes with a modular programmable low-power IEEE 802.15.4 radio and IPv6 network stack on each node. For the ease of administrative control and communication, we also developed a lightweight publish-subscribe overlay protocol called ROMANO that is used for bootstrapping the robots (also referred to as the IRISbots), collecting statistics, and direct control of individual robots, if needed. We detail the modular architecture of the IRIS testbed design along with the system implementation details and localization performance statistics.

AB  - We study the labeled multi-robot path planning problem in continuous 2D and 3D domains in the absence of obstacles where robots must not collide with each other. For an arbitrary number of robots in arbitrary initial and goal arrangements, we derive a polynomial time, complete algorithm that produces solutions with constant-factor optimality guarantees on both makespan and distance optimality, in expectation, under the assumption that the robot labels are uniformly randomly distributed. Our algorithm only requires a small constant-factor expansion of the initial and goal configuration footprints for solving the problem, i.e., the problem can be solved in a fairly small bounded region. Beside theoretical guarantees, we present a thorough computational evaluation of the proposed solution. In addition to the baseline implementation, adapting an effective (but non-polynomial time) routing subroutine, we also provide a highly efficient implementation that quickly computes near-optimal solutions. Hardware experiments on the microMVP platform composed of non-holonomic robots confirms the practical applicability of our algorithmic pipeline.

AB  - Modular self-folding robots are versatile systems that can change their own shape from two-dimensional patterns at instant commands. This reconfigurability is commonly restrained by power limitation in autonomous environments, The robotic systems with insufficient torque may lead to inaccurate movements and even transformation failures. This paper presents methodology for optimized reconfiguration planning with torque limitation in modular self-folding robots. We determine reconfiguration schemes with optimal initial pattern and robotic base that result in minimal peak torque by minimizing robotic inertia of the modular architecture. We present minimal bounding box and capacitated spanning tree heuristic algorithms to generate optimal initial patterns and propose 3 heuristic rules for robotic base selection. Our approach is demonstrated in simulation by applying the algorithms to the robotic concept of Mori, a modular origami robot. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms yield reconfiguration schemes with low peak torque, thereby appropriate for real-time applications in modular robotic systems.

By expressing the system with the port-Hamiltonian system, the proposed method can be applied to the nonholonomic system as well as fully actuated mechanical systems. The feedback controller for nonlinear impedance control is acquired by utilizing the results of generalized canonical transformation for port-Hamiltonian system. In addition, we investigate the passivity of the closed loop system and discuss the characteristics of the controlled system. A numerical simulation of two-wheeled vehicle shows the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB  - The sequential online tuning for controller gains is required for the continuous action of the riding into parallel two-wheeled scooter and the speed governing after riding by humanoid robot. The implemented controllers are different between the riding and the speed governing, and these tuning strategies are also different. In particular, the riding requires the immediate tuning in the short riding phase and the speed governing requires the accurate tuning to regulate the speed of humanoid robot. To the above requirements, this paper proposes the Sequential Online Learning Control (SOLC)method composed of the cascade connection of SGD-based open-loop Learning Control (SLC)and Mini-batch-based closed-loop Learning Control (MLC). SLC contributes the damping gain online tuning for the foot torque control during execution of riding, and MLC contributes the PID gains online tuning for the speed governing control. Finally, we show the validity of SOLC through the sequential experiment of riding and speed governing for parallel two-wheeled scooter by life-sized humanoid robot HRP2-JSK.

AB  - This paper presents the dynamic modelling and motion planning method for a quadruped robot that uses its legs for nonprehensile manipulation as well as locomotion. Three different working modes named Drive Mode, Inchworm Mode and Scoot Mode are proposed to enable the robot to move forward together with the object. We firstly introduce a universal model for these modes and deduce its dynamic equation. Then the contact force constraints are combined and mapped to the system state variables. Based on the acquired state acceleration constraints, the motion planning problem can be solved by designing system state paths in the phase space. After that, we described the mathematical problems within the three working modes and generate the robot motions accordingly. Finally, experimental results obtained through simulations and physical tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB  - Nascent endoscopic therapeutic procedures, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, enable unparalleled access to and removal of mid-size cancerous neoplasia from within the gastrointestinal tract. However, the remote locations of these lesions often incur substantial distal dexterity which imparts appreciable cognitive loading on the clinician and opens up the possibility of adverse events such as intestinal perforation due to limited dexterity and a lack of sensory feedback. In this work, we introduce a mm-scale, tip-mounted robotic system, EndoMODRA (Endoscopic Module for On-Demand Robotic Assistance), which interfaces with commercially-available endoscopic tools and provides additional dexterity and feedback sensing using on-board actuators and sensors, decoupling tool motion from endoscope motion. Leveraging alternative high-energy-density actuation strategies and monolithic, printed-circuit-inspired manufacturing processes, all actuation and sensing is fully contained within the distally-mounted module, obviating the need for a continuous mechanical transmission to a proximal motor package. We develop a fuzzy-tuned PID/PWM controller for closing the loop distally to enable closed-loop position-controlled trajectory execution using onboard actuation and sensing, realizing fully -distal loop closure in an endoscope-mounted robotic module with no proximal actuation or sensing component. Controller performance is validated on a fully-integrated module with on-board sensing, demonstrating the ability to execute pre-determined trajectories as well as real-time rate-based teleoperation.

AB  - We are interested in the problem of time-optimal control of omnidirectional robots with bounded acceleration (TOC-ORBA). While there exist approximate solutions for such problems, and exact solutions with unbounded acceleration, exact solvers to the TOC-ORBA problem have remained elusive until now. In this paper, we present a real-time solver for true time-optimal control of omnidirectional robots with bounded acceleration. We first derive the general parameterized form of the solution to the TOC-ORBA problem by application of Pontryagin's maximum principle. We then frame the boundary value problem of TOC-ORBA as an optimization problem over the parameterized control space. To overcome local minima and poor initial guesses to the optimization problem, we introduce a two-stage optimal control solver (TSOCS): The first stage computes an upper bound to the total time for the TOC-ORBA problem and holds the time constant while optimizing the parameters of the trajectory to approach the boundary value conditions. The second stage uses the parameters found by the first stage, and relaxes the constraint on the total time to solve for the parameters of the complete TOC-ORBA problem. Furthermore, we implement TSOCS as a closed loop controller to overcome actuation errors on real robots in realtime. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of TSOCS in simulation and on real robots, showing that 1) it runs in real time, generating solutions in less than 0.5ms on average; 2) it generates faster trajectories compared to an approximate solver; and 3) it is able to solve TOC-ORBA problems with nonzero final velocities that were previously unsolvable in real-time.

AB  - This paper presents a soft actuator embedded with conductive liquid metal and shape memory epoxy (SME) which function together to enable self-sensing, tunable mechanical degrees of freedom (DoF), and variable stiffness. We embedded thermoplastic shape memory epoxy in the bottom portion of the actuator. Different sections of the SME could be selectively softened by an implanted conductive silver yarn located at different positions. When an electric current passes through the conductive silver yarn, it induces a phase transition that changes the epoxy from stiff state to compliant state. Each section of SME could be softened within 5 s by applying a current of 200 mA to the silver yarn. To acquire the strain curvature, eGaIn was infused into a microchannel surrounding the chambers of the soft actuator. A spiral-shaped eGaIn sensor was also attached to the tip of the actuator to perceive the contact with reliable dynamic force response. Systematic experiments were performed to characterize the stiffness, tunable DoF, and sensing property. We show the ability of the soft composite actuator to support a weight of 200g at the tip (as a cantilever) while maintaining the shape and the ability to recover its original shape after large bending deformation. In particular, seven different motion patterns could be achieved under the same pneumatic pressure of the actuator due to selectively heating the SME sections. A gripper which was fabricated by assembling two actuators to a base was able to grasp the weight up to 56 times of a single actuator through an appropriate motion pattern. For demonstration purposes, the gripper was used to grasp various objects by adjusting the DoF and stiffness with real-time feedback of the bending strain and the contact force.

AB  - We present a novel manufacturing process for creating monolithic, multi-chambered inflatable structures including both soft and rigid components. Specifically, our process involves stacking layers of textiles or plastics and thermal adhesive film, then bonding the structure with a heat press or in an oven. Several different ways of arranging textiles and thermal adhesive film in order to achieve airtight structures are presented. Since this process only uses materials that bend, but do not stretch, it permits the easy inclusion of rigid structures such as circuit boards, plates that constrain inflatable chambers to bend in specified locations, and rigid pieces that enable sections of a robot to be connected in a modular fashion. Additionally, the process permits folding layers before their assembly, leading to more complex geometries. We present three different possible seam types, and enumerate the different types of corners that can be constructed without leaking. We present measurements of the ability of these structures to support pressure and measurements of the strength of bonds between textiles and other materials. Finally, we present two examples of robots constructed using this manufacturing method, including a hybrid soft/rigid robotic arm and a soft robot that can roll along the ground.

The proposed navigation method outperforms previous works since it is able to successfully achieve collision-free movements towards the goal in environments with convex obstacles without relying on a priori information of the obstacles' shapes and locations. Simulations for the kinematic model of a soft continuum manipulator and preliminary experiments with a 2-segments soft continuum arm are performed, showing promising results and the potential for our approach to be applied widely.

AB  - This paper proposes a real-time method for estimating the shape of an elastic rod using a robot manipulator equipped with a sense of force. The proposed method does not use optical sensing devices, such as cameras or lasers, but relies only upon the sense of force in the manipulator. In the proposed method, the deformation of an elastic rod is calculated from the obtained force/torque information using the discretized Kirchhoff elastic rod model, and the three-dimensional shape of the rod is then estimated. Furthermore, by integrating the force information with the orientation of the manipulator end-effector, the proposed method can evaluate the effect of gravity on the shape estimation accurately. Experiments were carried out to verify the proposed method, where a thin elastic strip was employed as a typical elastic rod, attached to the end-effector of the robot manipulator, bent and twisted into various shapes. The results show that the proposed method that compensates for gravity is better than a method without gravity compensation, and it estimated the 142 mm length strip shape with a position error no greater than 7.76 mm and an average calculation time of 4.24 ms.

AB  - Both Optimal Control and Search-based Planning are used extensively for path planning and have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose an algorithm FOCS (Fusion of Optimal Control and Search) that combines these two classes of approaches together. FOCS finds a path exploiting the advantages of both approaches while providing a bound on the sub-optimality of its solution. The returned path is a concatenation of the path found in the implicit graph constructed by search and the path generated by following the negative gradient of the value function obtained as a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We analyze the algorithm and illustrate its effectiveness in finding a minimum-time path for a car-like vehicle in different environments.

AB  - A motion planning algorithm computes the motion of a robot by computing a path through its configuration space. To improve the runtime of motion planning algorithms, we propose to nest robots in each other, creating a nested quotient-space decomposition of the configuration space. Based on this decomposition we define a new roadmap-based motion planning algorithm called the Quotient-space roadMap Planner (QMP). The algorithm starts growing a graph on the lowest dimensional quotient space, switches to the next quotient space once a valid path has been found, and keeps updating the graphs on each quotient space simultaneously until a valid path in the configuration space has been found. We show that this algorithm is probabilistically complete and outperforms a set of state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in the open motion planning library (OMPL).

AB  - Mobile robots have been used for various purposes with different functionalities which require them to freely move in environments containing both static and dynamic obstacles to accomplish given tasks. One of the most relevant capabilities in terms of navigating a mobile robot in such an environment is to find a safe path to a goal position. This paper shows that there exists an accurate solution to the Laplace equation which allows finding a collision-free path and that it can be efficiently calculated for a rectangular bounded domain such as a map which is represented as an image. This is accomplished by the use of the monogenic scale space resulting in a vector field which describes the attracting and repelling forces from the obstacles and the goal. The method is shown to work in reasonably convex domains and by the use of tessellation of the environment map for non-convex environments.

AB  - Motion planning algorithms attempt to find a good compromise between planning time and quality of solution. Due to their heuristic nature, they are typically configured with several parameters. In this paper we demonstrate that, in many scenarios, the widely used default parameter values are not ideal. However, finding the best parameters to optimise some metric(s) is not trivial because the size of the parameter space can be large. We evaluate and compare the efficiency of four different methods (i.e. random sampling, AUC-Bandit, random forest, and bayesian optimisation) to tune the parameters of two motion planning algorithms, BKPIECE and RRT-connect. We present a table-top-reaching scenario where the seven degrees-of-freedom KUKA LWR robotic arm has to move from an initial to a goal pose in the presence of several objects in the environment. We show that the best methods for BKPIECE (AUC-Bandit) and RRT-Connect (random forest) improve the performance by 4.5x and 1.26x on average respectively. Then, we generate a set of random scenarios of increasing complexity, and we observe that optimal parameters found in simple environments perform well in more complex scenarios. Finally, we find that the time required to evaluate parameter configurations can be reduced by more than 2/3 with low error. Overall, our results demonstrate that for a variety of motion planning problems it is possible to find solutions that significantly improve the performance over default configurations while requiring very reasonable computation times.

AB  - Most existing motion planning algorithms assume that a map (of some quality) is fully determined prior to generating a motion plan. In many emerging applications of robotics, e.g., fast-moving agile aerial robots with constrained embedded computational platforms and visual sensors, dense maps of the world are not immediately available, and they are computationally expensive to construct. We propose a new algorithm for generating plan graphs which couples the perception and motion planning processes for computational efficiency. In a nutshell, the proposed algorithm iteratively switches between the planning sub-problem and the mapping sub-problem, each updating based on the other until a valid trajectory is found. The resulting trajectory retains a provable property of providing an optimal trajectory with respect to the full (unmapped) environment, while utilizing only a fraction of the sensing data in computational experiments.

AB  - Autonomous cars can perform poorly for many reasons. They may have perception issues, incorrect dynamics models, be unaware of obscure rules of human traffic systems, or follow certain rules too conservatively. Regardless of the exact failure mode of the car, often human drivers around the car are behaving correctly. For example, even if the car does not know that it should pull over when an ambulance races by, other humans on the road will know and will pull over. We propose to make socially cohesive cars that leverage the behavior of nearby human drivers to act in ways that are safer and more socially acceptable. The simple intuition behind our algorithm is that if all the humans are consistently behaving in a particular way, then the autonomous car probably should too. We analyze the performance of our algorithm in a variety of scenarios and conduct a user study to assess people's attitudes towards socially cohesive cars. We find that people are surprisingly tolerant of mistakes that cohesive cars might make in order to get the benefits of driving in a car with a safer, or even just more socially acceptable behavior.

AB  - For socially assistive robots (SAR)to be accepted into complex and stochastic human environments, it is important to account for subtle social norms. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to socially-aware navigation (SAN)which garnered an immense interest in the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)community. We use a multi-objective optimization tool called the Pareto Concavity Elimination Transformation (PaC-cET)to capture the non-linear human navigation behavior, a novel contribution to the community. A candidate point on a trajectory is scored (1)for its progress towards the goal, and (2)based on autonomously-sensed distance-based features that capture the social norms and associated social costs. Rather than use a finely-tuned linear combination of these costs, we use PaCcET to select an optimized future trajectory point, associated with a non-linear combination of the costs. Existing research in this domain concentrates on geometric reasoning, model-based, and learning approaches, which have their own pros and cons. This approach is distinct from prior work in this area. We showed in a simulation that the PaCcET-based trajectory planner not only is able to avoid collisions and reach the intended destination in static and dynamic environments but also considers a human's personal space i.e. rules of proxemics in the trajectory selection process.

AB  - Sampling-based planning algorithms have been extensively exploited to solve a wide variety of problems. In recent years, many efforts have been dedicated to extend these tools to solve problems involving constraints, such as geometric loop-closure, which lead the valid Configuration Space (CS) to collapse to a lower-dimensional manifold. One proposed solution considers an approximation of the constrained Configuration Space that is obtained by relaxing constraints up to a desired tolerance. The resulting set has then non-zero measure, allowing to exploit classical planning algorithms to search for a path connecting two given states. When constraints involve kinematic loops in the system, relaxation generally bears to undesired contact forces, which need to be compensated during execution by a proper control action. We propose a new tool that exploits relaxation to plan in presence of constraints. Local motions inside the approximated manifold are found as the result of an iterative scheme that uses Quadratic Optimization to proceed towards a new sample without falling outside the relaxed region. By properly guiding the exploration, paths are found with smaller relaxation factors and the need of a dedicated controller to compensate errors is reduced. We complete the analysis by showing the feasibility of the approach with experiments on a real platform.

We design a novel gait for the snake using a gait design method that configures the target form of the snake robot by connecting simple shapes. The climbing motion is executed via shift control and the corresponding motion required to catch the next step on the ladder. In addition, we developed a snake robot that has a smooth exterior body surface through construction of pectinate-shaped parts of the links. We demonstrated the effectiveness of both the proposed gait and the design of the snake robot experimentally.

AB  - This paper presents modeling of robotic fish propelled by a hybrid tail with Servo and IPMC actuated two joints. The first joint is driven by a servo motor, which generates flapping motion for main propulsion. The second joint is actuated by a soft actuator, or ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscle, which directs the propelled fluid for steering. A dynamic model is developed to capture the 2D motion dynamics of the robotic fish. The model fully captures the actuation dynamics of the IPMC soft actuator, two-link tail motion dynamics, and body motion dynamics. Experimental results have shown that the robotic fish is capable of swimming forward (up to 0.45 body length/second) and turning left and right (up to 40 degree/sec) with a small turning radius (less than half a body length). Finally, the dynamic model has been validated with experimental data, in terms of steady-state forward speed and turning speed versus the flapping frequency.

In order to extend the areas that can be explored, we propose a method and a robot capable of running on the surface of water without having to bypass the puddles and streams that exist on uneven terrain. The method that enables the robot to run on the water surface is bio-inspired by the basilisk lizard that can walk on the surface of water. We developed a blade-type crawler robot with a simple and reliable mechanism, capable of traversing uneven terrain at high speed. The robot with the method was tested on a real water surface and the result confirmed the ability of the robot to run on the water surface.

By taking design principles from observation of Pteromyini, commonly known as the flying squirrel, which shows balanced performances in both aerial and terrestrial locomotion, a novel robotic platform with the ability of gliding and walking is designed. The flexible membrane and gliding method of Pteromyini have been applied to the robot design. The legs of the robot were optimized to perform with regulated motor torques in both walking and gliding. The robot glided with an average gliding ratio of 1.88 and controlled its angle-of-attack for slowing down to land safely. The robot was able to walk utilizing different gait patterns. These results demonstrated our robot's balanced multi-modal locomotion of gliding and walking.

First, a dynamic model for lizard-inspired robot is derived to simulate the lateral body motion of real lizard. Based upon the simulation using dynamic model, the lizard-inspired robot is tactfully built so that its hind leg is optimally designed on a 4-bar mechanism and its body is simplified to consist of two body links and a tail connected by two revolute joints. The experiments verify that the proposed robot can maintain its moving direction via proper lateral motions during high-speed bipedal running similar to that of real lizard.

AB  - Albatross has an energy efficient flying pattern (dynamic soaring) among seabirds. This interesting point encourages us to exploit its flying natural dynamics so as to control the flying robots on energy efficient and robust gaits. In doing so, we study the albatross dynamic soaring from analytical and biological perspectives and realize that to generate the dynamic soaring instead of trajectory control, the mechanical energy should be regulated. Accordingly, the control objective is set to mechanical energy regulation, and the bank angle and lift coefficient are computed to satisfy this objective. The presented method is simulated on a standard albatross model and generates two different types of dynamic soaring; O-shaped and a-shaped patterns. In addition, by means of simulations, it is investigated that the presented method is robust in face of variations in initial conditions and unexpected disturbances in the environment's model; i.e., they cannot disturb the stability and cyclic behavior of the system. Moreover, the simulation results are compared with pieces of natural evidence from albatross and interesting similarities are observed.

AB  - Currently, serious accidents are caused frequently by the aging of sewer pipes. Therefore, to inspect sewer pipes, we developed a peristaltic crawling robot that reproduces the locomotion of an earthworm. This robot can drive for more than 100m, and it can be used for the maintenance of sewer pipes (100A pipes). However, the speed of the robot is low. There are two causes. First, the units of the previous robot have steps of artificial muscle fastening. These steps increase the diameter of the artificial muscles. A smaller diameter of the artificial muscles is advantageous for the speed of the robot inside the pipes. Second, the previous robot has slow air response. In this study, we used large-sized solenoid valves to overcome this drawback.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a method for motion learning aimed at the execution of autonomous household chores by service robots in real environments. For robots to act autonomously in a real environment, it is necessary to define the appropriate actions for the environment. However, it is difficult to define these actions manually. Therefore, body motions that are common to multiple actions are defined as motion primitives. Complex actions can then be learned by combining these motion primitives. For learning motion primitives, we propose a reference-point and object-dependent Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model (RPOD-GP-HSMM). For verification, a robot is teleoperated to perform the actions included in several domestic household chores. The robot then learns the associated motion primitives from the robot's body information and object information.

AB  - Intelligent service robots are used at a significant level to uplift the living standards of domestic users. These robots are expected to possess human-friendly interactive features. Service robots should be able to provide a variety of tasks to support independent living of users in domestic environments. Therefore, a service robot often needs to approach users to execute these services and the approach toward the users should be human friendly. In order to achieve this, proxemics planner of a service robot should be cable of deciding the approaching proxemics based on user behavior. This paper proposes a method to decide the approaching proxemics based on the behavior of the user. A fuzzy interference system has been designed to decide the proxemics based on the user behavior identified through body parameters. This leads to an effective interaction mechanism initiated by a robot in such a way that the approaching scenario looks more humanlike. The proposed concept has been implemented on MIRob platform and experiments were conducted in an artificially created domestic environment. The experimental results of the proposed system have been compared with results of a human study to evaluate the performance of the system.

AB  - This paper presents a new model to make robots capable of approaching and engaging people with a human-like behavior, while they are walking in a side-by-side formation with a person. This method extends our previous work [1], which allows the robot to adapt its navigation behaviour according to the person being accompanied and the dynamic environment. In the current work, the robot is able to predict the best encounter point between the human-robot group and the approached person. Then, in the encounter point the robot modifies its position to achieve an engagement with both people. The encounter point is computed using a gradient descent method that takes into account all people predictions. Moreover, we make use of the Extended Social Force Model (ESFM), and it is modified to include the dynamic goal. The method has been validated over several situations and in real-life experiments, in addition, a user study has been realized to reveal the social acceptability of the robot in this task.

AB  - Till date, various seven-degrees-of-freedom (7-DOF)robot arms have been developed globally. In general, the robot arms utilized in factories are required to possess speed, power, and accuracy. They are isolated from humans using a fence to ensure human safety. However, a home robot should work near humans at an appropriate speed without a fence. One approach to meeting this requirement involves the installation of various sensors on the robot to control and stop the robot safely even if a collision has occurred. However, a robot system is complicated and expensive. In order to give inherent safety to the robot, we should lighten the robot arm. In this study, a 7-DOF lightweight arm with a wide wrist-motion range is introduced. The weight of movable parts is approximately 2.87 kg. To achieve such properties, we propose the use of three mechanisms: a shoulder mechanism with hollow cylinders, a wrist mechanism with a wide workspace, and an integrated wrist and elbow mechanisms of high power. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of the robot is designed and developed. The experimental results demonstrate its powerful performance and wide workspace of the wrist.

AB  - With the purpose of achieving stable and energy efficient locomotion on the slippery road surface, a sliding locomotion robot without joint torque but indirectly controlled by an active wobbling mass is recently proposed. In this paper, we deepen the analysis of the mechanism of the indirectly controlled sliding locomotion for further optimization and generalization. First, we derive the equations of dynamics and control. Second, we estimate the natural frequency of the robot, the moving speed and energy efficiency are also evaluated with respect to forcing amplitude and frequency of the wobbling mass. Third, the Arnol'd tongue is introduced to analyze the relationship between achieving efficient locomotion and being entrained. In addition, phase oscillation and synchronization phenomenon are analyzed via hysteresis plot to further interpret the unusual shapes of the Arnol'd tongues. Finally, we analyze the entrained, however, inefficient locomotion by reconfirming the rolling constraints from the mechanical energy dissipation point of view. Our results help better understanding of the indirectly controlling mechanism, and the methods can be applied to other indirectly controlled locomotion robots.

AB  - The ability to move around the environment is one of the most important capabilities of a mobile robot. Although navigation is considered an already achieved capacity, there is still much work to be done to integrate navigation with high level reasoning and acting. Navigate in indoor environments also involve complex actions, such as opening doors, use elevators, and many others. We propose a topological navigation system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Planning. Starting from a symbolic representation of the environment, navigation tasks are divided into phases, in which different actions are required. This approach has demonstrated to be very effective to plan the operations of a robot at indoor environments. The final result is method compact, efficient and scalable. Our system has been successfully tested at European Robotics League in the humanoid robot Pepper.

AB  - Applying agrochemicals is the default procedure for conventional weed control in crop production, but has negative impacts on the environment. Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, i.e., distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also provides an improvement in the semantic segmentation performance.

AB  - In this work we introduce Natural Segmentation and Matching (NSM), an algorithm for reliable localization, using laser, in both urban and natural environments. Current state-of-the-art global approaches do not generalize well to structure-poor vegetated areas such as forests or orchards. In these environments clutter and perceptual aliasing prevents repeatable extraction of distinctive landmarks between different test runs. In natural forests, tree trunks are not distinctive, foliage intertwines and there is a complete lack of planar structure. In this paper we propose a method for place recognition which uses a more involved feature extraction process which is better suited to this type of environment. First, a feature extraction module segments stable and reliable object-sized segments from a point cloud despite the presence of heavy clutter or tree foliage. Second, repeatable oriented key poses are extracted and matched with a reliable shape descriptor using a Random Forest to estimate the current sensor's position within the target map. We present qualitative and quantitative evaluation on three datasets from different environments - the KITTI benchmark, a parkland scene and a foliage-heavy forest. The experiments show how our approach can achieve place recognition in woodlands while also outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches in urban scenarios without specific tuning.

AB  - Financial and social elements of modern societies are closely connected to the cultivation of corn. Due to its massive production, deficiencies during the cultivation process directly translate to major financial losses. Since proper surveillance in a large scale is still very challenging, the companies that specialize in optimizing crop yield are trying to address the problem at its root by developing hybrid plants able to resist the harsh conditions of the field. The selection of the best hybrid is not easy and every year hundreds of test plants with different phenotypic characteristics are planted while their performance is quantified by inconsistent and rough measurements gathered by humans. We propose a pipeline that takes advantage of the structure from motion technology to create a detailed 3D point cloud of a few plants and segment it into the basic elements of the scene; the ground, the plants, the plant stems, and the plant leaves. The focus is on the segmentation process through which several phenotypic characteristics of individual plants can be extracted. As an example, we show the results for the plant counting and plant height estimation processes where we achieve an accuracy of 88.1% and 89.2%.

AB  - This paper presents a novel agricultural robot for greenhouse applications. In many greenhouses, including the greenhouse used in this work, sets of pipes run along the floor between plant rows. These pipes are components of the greenhouse heating system, and doubles as rails for trolleys used by workers. A flat surface separates the start of each rail set at the greenhouse headland. If a robot is to autonomously drive along plant rows, and also be able to move from one set of rails to the next, it must be able to locomote both on rails and on flat surfaces. This puts requirements on mechanical design and navigation, as the robot must cope with two very different operational environments. The robot presented in this paper has been designed to overcome these challenges and allows for autonomous operation both in open environments and on rails by using only low-cost sensors. The robot is assembled using a modular system created by the authors and tested in a greenhouse during ordinary operation. Using the robot, we map the environment and automatically determine the starting point of each rail in the map. We also show how we are able to identify rails and estimate the robots pose relative to theses using only a low-cost 3D camera. When a rail is located, the robot makes the transition from floor to rail and travels along the row of plants before it moves to the next rail set which it has identified in the map. The robot is used for UV treatment of cucumber plants.

AB  - This paper presents the use of dynamic sensing strategies to improve detection results for a pepper harvesting robot. The algorithm decides if an additional viewpoint is needed and selects the best-fit viewpoint location from a predefined set of locations based on the predicted profitability of such an action. The suggestion of a possible additional viewpoint is based on image analysis for fruit and occlusion level detection, prediction of the expected number of additional targets sensed from that viewpoint, and final decision if choosing the additional viewpoint is beneficial. The developed heuristic was applied on 96 greenhouse images of 30 sweet peppers and resulted in up to 19% improved detection. The harvesting utility cost function decreased by up to 10% compared to the conventional single viewpoint strategy.

AB  - We present Dolphin, an extensible programming language for autonomous vehicle networks. A Dolphin program expresses an orchestrated execution of tasks defined compositionally for multiple vehicles. Building upon the base case of elementary one-vehicle tasks, the built-in operators include support for composing tasks in several forms, for instance according to concurrent, sequential, or event-based task flow. The language is implemented as a Groovy DSL, facilitating extension and integration with external software packages, in particular robotic toolkits. The paper describes the Dolphin language, its integration with an open-source toolchain for autonomous vehicles, and results from field tests using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

AB  - In recent years, we have observed a clear trend in the rapid rise of autonomous vehicles and robotics. One of the core technologies enabling these applications, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), imposes two main challenges: first, these workloads are computationally intensive and they often have real-time requirements; second, these workloads run on battery-powered mobile devices with limited energy budget. Hence, performance should be improved while simultaneously reducing energy consumption, two rather contradicting goals by conventional wisdom. Previous attempts to optimize SLAM performance and energy efficiency usually involve optimizing one function and fail to approach the problem systematically. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of visual inertial SLAM workloads on existing heterogeneous SoCs. Then based on the initial findings, we propose π-SoC, a heterogeneous SoC design that systematically optimize the IO interface, the memory hierarchy, as well as the the hardware accelerator. We implemented this system on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale MPSoC and was able to deliver over 60 FPS performance with average power less than 5 W.

AB  - Preprogramming of tasks still plays an important role in complex robotic systems despite the advances in automated planning and symbolic learning. Often, it is desired that end-users implement further tasks to adapt the robotic application to their needs. These user-defined tasks have to meet safety and integrity constraints for protecting the robotic platform and its users. We introduce a verifiable task specification language (vTSL) that enables to automatically prove that a task specification satisfies a set of predefined or task-specific constraints. We illustrate our approach using an example of a self-driving vehicle for intra-logistics and report experiences with two commercial applications.

AB  - Next-best-view algorithms are commonly used for covering known scenes, for example in search, maintenance, and mapping tasks. In this paper, we consider the problem of planning a strategy for covering articulated environments where the robot also has to manipulate objects to inspect obstructed areas. This problem is particularly challenging due to the many degrees of freedom resulting from the articulation. We propose to exploit graphics processing units present in many embedded devices to parallelize the computations of a greedy next-best-view approach. We implemented algorithms for costmap computation, path planning, as well as simulation and evaluation of viewpoint candidates in OpenGL for Embedded Systems and benchmarked the implementations on multiple device classes ranging from smartphones to multi-GPU servers. We introduce a heuristic for estimating a utility map from images rendered with strategically placed spherical cameras and show in simulation experiments that robots can successfully explore complex articulated scenes with our system.

AB  - We focus on the task of amodal 3D object detection, which is to predict object locations, dimensions, poses and categories in the real world. We introduce a 3D Convolutional Neural Network that takes a volumetric representation of an indoor scene as input and predicts 3D object bounding boxes, object categories, and orientations. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts, our approach does not depend on region proposal techniques to hypothesize object locations. We treat detection and recognition as one regression problem in a single network. Our elegant model is extremely fast and all predictions are reasoned from the global context of a point cloud in a continuous pipeline. We evaluate our approach on two standard datasets: the NYUv2 RGBD dataset and the SUN RGBD dataset. Experiments show that our approach is faster than start-of-the-art 3D detectors by several orders of magnitude towards real-time amodal 3D object detection.

AB  - This work proposes the utilization of sinc functions as kernels of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) models for encoding point-to-point kinematic behaviors. The proposed method presents a number of advantages with respect to the state of the art, as it (i) involves a simple learning technique, (ii) provides a method to determine the minimum required number of basis functions, based on the frequency content of the demonstrated motion and (iii) provides the ability to pre-define the reproduction accuracy of the learned behavior. The ability of the proposed model to accurately reproduce the behavior is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Comparisons with the Gaussian-based DMP model show the proposed method's superiority in terms of computational complexity of learning and accuracy for a specific number of kernels.

AB  - This paper addresses the optimization-based planning of collision-free motions for a dual-arm robot with kinematic constraints. Such problems arise, for example, when the robot has to move an object with both arms, whereby the two arms and the gripped object form a closed kinematic chain. Such constrained problems are hard to solve with sampling-based planners, because the probability that a random sample satisfies the closure constraint is practically zero. In contrast, the solution of optimization problems with equality constraints is a well-understood field of research. This paper formulates the motion planning task as optimization problem and proposes a numerical solution using the augmented Lagrangian method for handling constraints. The planner is compared to RRTs, CHOMP and TrajOpt on a set of randomly generated problems for a dual-arm robot with twelve degrees of freedom highlighting the advantages of optimization-based planning.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a novel point-to-point trajectory planner for serial robotic structures that combines the ability to avoid self-collisions and to respect motion constraints, while complying with the requirement of being C4 continuous. The latter property makes our approach also suited for 4th order dynamics flexible joint robots, which gained significant practical relevance recently. In particular, we address the problem of generating a smooth, kinematically nearly time-optimal SE(3) trajectory while simultaneously avoiding potential collisions of the robot end-effector with its base as well as respecting the Cartesian unreachable states induced by the joint limits of the proximal kinematic structure.

AB  - This paper is a preliminary exploration of how to solve the dual-manipulator path-planning problem from an energy perspective. A virtual spring is set up between the two manipulator bodies and becomes compressed as they move into the area of danger, thus producing elastic potential energy. The initial paths of the manipulators are modelled as two ends-fixed elastic ropes. The elastic potential energy stored in the virtual spring is distributed between the two elastic ropes in a certain proportion so as to deform them. In this way, the original paths of the two manipulators will deviate toward the direction of their respective bases thereby avoiding any collision crisis that may potentially occur. When the dual-manipulator moves away from the danger area, the elastic potential energy caused by the deviation of the elastic ropes will be converted back into energy stored by the virtual spring, such that the elastic ropes revert to their original state and drive the manipulators back to their initial paths. Simple but representative simulations are established and results of the simulations show the reliability of our proposed method.

AB  - We tackle the transition feasibility problem, that is the issue of determining whether there exists a feasible motion connecting two configurations of a legged robot. To achieve this we introduce CROC, a novel method for computing centroidal dynamics trajectories in multi-contact planning contexts. Our approach is based on a conservative and convex reformulation of the problem, where we represent the center of mass trajectory as a Bezier curve comprising a single free control point as a variable. Under this formulation, the transition problem is solved efficiently with a Linear Program (LP)of low dimension. We use this LP as a feasibility criterion, incorporated in a sampling-based contact planner, to discard efficiently unfeasible contact plans. We are thus able to produce robust contact sequences, likely to define feasible motion synthesis problems. We illustrate this application on various multi-contact scenarios featuring HRP2 and HyQ. We also show that we can use CROC to compute valuable initial guesses, used to warm-start non-linear solvers for motion generation methods. This method could also be used for the 0 and 1-Step capturability problem. The source code of CROC is available under an open source BSD-2 License.

In this paper we focus on specializing perceptual capabilities of mobile robots to new objects through a knowledge based, virtual scene rendering approach. Episodic memories of a robotic agent, gathered during the execution of a task are considered to be the main "theme". Variations of this theme are then generated based on background knowledge about the objects and data gathered with the purpose of learning new models for detection and recognition. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by adapting the perceptual capabilities of a mobile robot performing pick and place tasks, to recognize new sets of objects.

AB  - In the robotic field, navigation and path planning applications benefit from a wide range of visual systems (e.g, perspective cameras, depth cameras, catadioptric cameras, etc.). In outdoor conditions, these systems capture information in which sky regions cover a major segment of the images acquired. However, sky regions are discarded and are not considered as visual cue in vision applications. In this paper, we propose to estimate attitude of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) from sky information using a polarimetric camera. Theoretically, we provide a framework estimating the attitude from the skylight polarized patterns. We showcase this formulation on both simulated and real-word data sets which proved the benefit of using polarimetric sensors along with other visual sensors in robotic applications.

AB  - Accurate localization of other traffic participants is a vital task in autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art systems employ a combination of sensing modalities such as RGB cameras and LiDARs for localizing traffic participants, but monocular localization demonstrations have been confined to plain roads. We demonstrate - to the best of our knowledge - the first results for monocular object localization and shape estimation on surfaces that are non-coplanar with the moving ego vehicle mounted with a monocular camera. We approximate road surfaces by local planar patches and use semantic cues from vehicles in the scene to initialize a local bundle-adjustment like procedure that simultaneously estimates the 3D pose and shape of the vehicles, and the orientation of the local ground plane on which the vehicle stands. We also demonstrate that our approach transfers from synthetic to real data, without any hyperparameter-/fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed approach on the KITTI and SYNTHIA-SF benchmarks, for a variety of road plane configurations. The proposed approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art for monocular object localization on arbitrarily-shaped roads.

AB  - In a goal-oriented Human Robot Collaborative (HRC) scenario, where the goal is to complete an assembly process, a robust object tracker might not necessarily fulfill its functional role due to the dynamic nature of HRC. Moreover, for an efficient HRC, the functional role of the object tacker should not only be limited to localizing and tracking objects for robotic manipulation. It should also help to determine the current state of the assembly process and verify if the chosen action has been successfully performed and thus to enable an uninterrupted completion of an HRC assembly process. We present a Context Enhanced Framework for Multi Object Tracking, that i) allows uninterrupted completion of an assembly process, ii) improves the overall functional accuracy of the object tracker from 49 percent to 96 percent, and iii) enables the object tracker to handle multiple instance of multiple objects in a HRC setting.

AB  - Measuring the quality of roads and ensuring they are ready for autonomous driving is important for future transportation systems. Here we focus on developing metrics and algorithms to assess lane marking (LM)qualities from an egocentric view of an inspection vehicle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS)receiver, a frontal-view camera, and a light detection and ranging (LIDAR)system. We propose three quality metrics for LMs: correctness, shape, and visibility. The correctness metric measures the divergence between the expected LMs based on prior map inputs and the actual sensor inputs. The shape metric evaluates smoothness in road curvature and width range. The visibility metric evaluates the contrast between LMs and background road surfaces. We propose a dual-modal algorithm to compute these metrics. We have implemented the algorithms and tested them under KITTI dataset. The results show that our metrics can successfully detect LM anomalies in all testing scenarios.

AB  - Real-time 3D reconstruction using low-cost commodity sensors like Kinect or Xtion has been successfully applied in a wide range of fields like augmented reality, robotic teleoperation, and medical diagnosis. Due to the assumption of static scene, popular 3D reconstruction technologies such as KinectFusion and KinFu, find truthful reconstruction with fast motion camera or segmenting a moving object to be a challenge. In this paper, we propose a weighted iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that uses both depth and RGB information to enhance the stability of camera tracking. Additionally, a GPU-based region growing method that combines depth, normal and intensity level as similarity criteria, is also applied to segment foreground moving objects accurately. For real-time processing and GPU memory efficiency, we also design a combination of point-based and volumetric representation to reconstruct moving objects and static scene, respectively. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that our proposed method improves real-time 3D reconstruction on the performance of camera tracking and segmentation of moving objects with reduced computational complexity.

AB  - We propose a novel method to enable fast autonomous flight in cluttered environments. Typically, autonomous navigation through a complex environment requires a continuous heuristic search on a graph generated by a k-connected grid or a probabilistic scheme. As the vehicle progresses, modification of the graph with data from onboard sensors is expensive as is search on the graph, especially if the paths must be kino-dynamically feasible. We suggest that computation needed to find safe paths during fast flight can be greatly reduced if we precompute and carefully arrange a dense set of alternative paths before the flight. Any prior map information can be used to prune the alternative paths to come up with a data structure that enables very fast online computation to deal with obstacles that are not on the map but only detected by onboard sensors. To test this idea, we have conducted a large number of flight experiments in structured (large industrial facilities) and unstructured (forests-like) environments. We show that even in the most unstructured environments, this method enables flight at a speed up to 10m/s while avoiding obstacles detected from onboard sensors.

AB  - A motion planner is developed for guiding a small aerobatic fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle to a desired goal region in a highly constrained, three-dimensional, known environment with static obstacles. The planner is based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm, and pieces together feasible trajectories from a library of motion primitives. Among other more conventional motion primitives, the library includes three extreme maneuvers: a cruise-to-hover transition, a hover-to-cruise transition, and an aggressive turn-around. The algorithm is efficient; it can be run in real-time to rapidly generate a plan starting from the aircraft's configuration at run-time. The motion planner is closely coupled to a feedback controller. Simulations using an aircraft dynamics model demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to guide and control the aircraft to a desired goal region. Preliminary flight test results are also presented.

AB  - This paper presents the motion planning of a novel aerial robotic system with a long-bar extension and two arms for long-reach manipulation in cluttered environments. The novel aerial long-reach manipulator includes a passive revolute joint between the aerial platform and the dual arm. This feature minimises the torque induced to the aerial system in case of unexpected collisions of the manipulator. The motion planning problem is addressed considering jointly the complete set of configuration variables for the aerial platform and the dual arm. Furthermore, the planner has been built over the fundamentals of RRT* algorithms in order to optimise the performance of the trajectories in terms of energy and time. The proposed planning method has been experimentally validated in a realistic industrial scenario, the transportation of a long bar through a cluttered environment consisting of several pipe structures.

AB  - Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have the advantage of moving freely in 3D space. However, creating compact and sparse map representations that can be efficiently used for planning for such robots is still an open problem. In this paper, we take maps built from noisy sensor data and construct a sparse graph containing topological information that can be used for 3D planning. We use a Euclidean Signed Distance Field, extract a 3D Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD), and obtain a thin skeleton diagram representing the topological structure of the environment. We then convert this skeleton diagram into a sparse graph, which we show is resistant to noise and changes in resolution. We demonstrate global planning over this graph, and the orders of magnitude speed-up it offers over other common planning methods. We validate our planning algorithm in real maps built onboard an MAV, using RGB-D sensing.

AB  - This paper develops and compares two motion planning algorithms for a tethered UAV with and without the possibility of the tether contacting the confined and cluttered environment. Tethered aerial vehicles have been studied due to their advantages such as power duration, stability, and safety. However, the disadvantages brought in by the extra tether have not been well investigated by the robotic locomotion community, especially when the tethered agent is locomoting in a non-free space occupied with obstacles. In this work, we propose two motion planning frameworks that (1) reduce the reachable configuration space by taking into account the tether and (2) deliberately plan (and relax) the contact point(s) of the tether with the environment and enable an equivalent reachable configuration space as the non-tethered counterpart would have. Both methods are tested on a physical robot, Fotokite Pro. With our approaches, tethered aerial vehicles could find their applications in confined and cluttered environments with obstacles as opposed to ideal free space, while still maintaining the advantages from the usage of a tether. The motion planning strategies are particularly suitable for marsupial heterogeneous robotic teams, such as visual servoing/assisting for another mobile, tele-operated primary robot.

AB  - There are many applications such as surveillance and mapping that require persistent monitoring of terrains. In this work, we consider a heterogeneous team of aerial and ground robots that are tasked with monitoring a terrain along a given path. Both types of robots are equipped with cameras that can monitor the terrain within their fields-of-view. We also consider the ability of the aerial robots to land occasionally on the terrain to recharge. The objective is to find a path for all the robots to reduce the time required. Determining optimal routes for the robots is a challenging problem because of constrained visibility due to the terrain and fuel limitations of the robots. We devise an MILP formulation for the problem using a 1.5 dimensional representation model. A branch-and-cut framework is used to implement the MILP and involves the design of a separation algorithm to compute valid inequalities. We report results from extensive simulations and proof-of-concept field experiments to show the efficacy of our approach.

AB  - A combination of several autonomous UAVs can be used to perform collaborative tasks. Such a combination is referred to as a swarm of drones. The use of multiple platforms can extend the system global capacities thanks to the resulting variety of embedded sensors and to information sharing. In this case, path planning and thus obstacles avoidance is still a major task. To deal with this issue, mobility models have to be implemented. Our contribution presented in this paper is a mobility model for swarms of UAVs based on the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) principle. In our model, the involved UAVs collaborate by sharing data about the obstacles that they detected. By doing so, a UAV which is not close enough to an obstacle to detect it thanks to its own sensors will still have the proper data to take this obstacle into account in its path planning. To validate our mobility strategies with realistic constraints we simulate the performances of existing sensors and transmitters, and consider real-world environment.

AB  - This paper considers a new, complex problem of UAV/UGV collaborative efforts to search and capture attackers under uncertainty. The goal of the defenders (UAV/UGV team) is to stop all attackers as quickly as possible, before they arrive at their selected goal. The uncertainty considered is twofold: the defenders do not know the attackers' location and destination, and there is also uncertainty in the defenders' sensing. We suggest a real-time algorithmic framework for the defenders, combining entropy and stochastic-temporal belief, that aims at optimizing the probability of a quick and successful capture of all of the attackers. We have empirically evaluated the algorithmic framework, and have shown its efficiency and significant performance improvement compared to other solutions.

AB  - One of the safest and most reliable strategies for vehicle's collision avoidance is embedded control at low level to guarantee safe motion in all situations using on-board sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight collision avoidance strategy that can be implemented as a low level motion control to achieve safe motion while simultaneously tracking the robot's reference control input. This strategy is designed to be general so that it can be easily integrated with most control designs, with the primary target of resource-constrained robot swarms that act in real-time, dynamic environments. The main advantages of our approach are a very simple structure and low computational requirements. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed collision avoidance strategy through two simulated scenarios and with physical robots. We believe our design can be directly used in many areas, such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation and planetary exploration.

AB  - Predictive control methods for walking commonly use low dimensional models, such as a Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), for simplifying the complex dynamics of legged robots. This paper identifies the physical limitations of the modeling methods that do not account for external disturbances, and then analyzes the issues of numerical stability of Model Predictive Control (MPC)using different models with variable receding horizons. We propose a new modeling formulation that can be used for both gait planning and feedback control in an MPC scheme. The advantages are the improved numerical stability for long prediction horizons and the robustness against various disturbances. Benchmarks were rigorously studied to compare the proposed MPC scheme with the existing ones in terms of numerical stability and disturbance rejection. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated in both MATLAB and Gazebo simulations.

AB  - This paper presents the design and experimental evaluations of an articulated robotic limb called Capler-Leg. The key element of Capler-Leg is its single-stage cable-pulley transmission combined with a high-gap radius motor. Our cable-pulley system is designed to be as light-weight as possible and to additionally serve as the primary cooling element, thus significantly increasing the power density and efficiency of the overall system. The total weight of active elements on the leg, i.e. the stators and the rotors, contribute more than 60 % of the total leg weight, which is an order of magnitude higher than most existing robots. The resulting robotic leg has low inertia, high torque transparency, low manufacturing cost, no backlash, and a low number of parts. The Capler-Leg system itself, serves as an experimental setup for evaluating the proposed cable-pulley design in terms of robustness and efficiency. A continuous jump experiment shows a remarkable 96.5 % recuperation rate, measured at the battery output. This means that almost all the mechanical energy output during push-off is returned back to the battery during touch-down.

AB  - A common approach to the generation of walking patterns for humanoid robots consists in adopting a layered control architecture. This paper proposes an architecture composed of three nested control loops. The outer loop exploits a robot kinematic model to plan the footstep positions. In the mid layer, a predictive controller generates a Center of Mass trajectory according to the well-known table-cart model. Through a whole-body inverse kinematics algorithm, we can define joint references for position controlled walking. The outcomes of these two loops are then interpreted as inputs of a stack-of-task QP-based torque controller, which represents the inner loop of the presented control architecture. This resulting architecture allows the robot to walk also in torque control, guaranteeing higher level of compliance. Real world experiments have been carried on the humanoid robot iCub.

AB  - Successful human-robot collaboration depends on a shared understanding of task state and current goals. In nonlinear or freeform tasks without an explicit task model, robot partners are unable to provide assistance without the ability to translate perception into meaningful task knowledge. In this paper, we explore the utility of multimodal recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units for real-time subtask recognition in order to provide context-aware assistance during generic assembly tasks. We train RNNs to recognize specific subtasks in individual modalities, then combine the high-level representations of these networks through a nonlinear connection layer to create a multimodal subtask recognition system. We report results from implementing the system on a robot that uses the subtask recognition system to provide predictive assistance to a human partner during a laboratory experiment involving a human-robot team completing an assembly task. Generalizability of the system is evaluated through training and testing on separate tasks with some similar subtasks. Our results demonstrate the value of such a system in providing assistance to human partners during a freeform assembly scenario and increasing humans' perception of the robot's agency and usefulness.

AB  - We address the problem of interactively controlling the workspace of a mobile robot to ensure a human-aware navigation. This is especially of relevance for non-expert users living in human-robot shared spaces, e.g. home environments, since they want to keep the control of their mobile robots, such as vacuum cleaning or companion robots. Therefore, we introduce virtual borders that are respected by a robot while performing its tasks. For this purpose, we employ a RGB-D Google Tango tablet as human-robot interface in combination with an augmented reality application to flexibly define virtual borders. We evaluated our system with 15 non-expert users concerning accuracy, teaching time and correctness and compared the results with other baseline methods based on visual markers and a laser pointer. The experimental results show that our method features an equally high accuracy while reducing the teaching time significantly compared to the baseline methods. This holds for different border lengths, shapes and variations in the teaching process. Finally, we demonstrated the correctness of the approach, i.e. the mobile robot changes its navigational behavior according to the user-defined virtual borders.

AB  - Robot learning by demonstration gives robots the ability to learn tasks which they have not been programmed to do before. The paradigm allows robots to work in a greater range of real-world applications in our daily life. However, this paradigm has traditionally been applied to learn tasks from a single demonstration modality. This restricts the approach to be scaled to learn and execute a series of tasks in a real-life environment. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal learning approach using DMP+ with linear decay integrated in a dialogue system with speech and ontology for the robot to learn seamlessly through natural interaction modalities (like an apprentice) while learning or re-learning is done on the fly to allow partial updates to a learned task to reduce potential user fatigue and operational downtime in teaching. The performance of new DMP+ with linear decay system is statistically benchmarked against state-of-the-art DMP implementations. A gluing demonstration is also conducted to show how the system provides seamless learning of multiple tasks in a flexible manufacturing set-up.

AB  - Robots deployed in large human-populated indoor environments such as shopping malls, airports etc., inadvertently communicate via wireless networks for enhanced perception and decision making capabilities. Owing to highly dynamic signal attenuation characteristics in such environments, connectivity issues may arise during robotic navigation, leading to disruption in information flow causing potential danger. Exact modeling of signal propagation for estimating spatial signal variation is usually challenging. Moreover, the presence of dynamic humans also add a layer of temporal signal variation complexities. Thus, this paper introduces a generative approach for embedding radio signal strength constraints within networked service/social robot navigation in large human-populated environments. Initially, we propose a Gaussian Process based online spatio-temporal signal strength prediction model that, as opposed to the current state of the art, also aims to take into account the temporal fading arising due to the presence of human crowds. We then devise a transient-goal driven navigation strategy to realize a sub-optimal path towards a goal, that is aimed at resolving both communication-aware and human-aware planning constraints. Evaluations of the proposed signal prediction model demonstrate the advantages of our approach with respect to the current state of the art. The efficacy of the navigation strategy in also demonstrated simulations and using hardware experiments conducted on a robotic wheelchair operating in a large shopping mall.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a walking assistance device by controlling trunk and pelvis motion. Human gait motion is a whole-body exercise that includes both lower body and upper body motion. Therefore, focusing on trunk and pelvic rotational motion, assist and resist the walking by applying external forces. By introducing periodic input control, control the timing of the supplementary force, and assist the walking. As an experimental result, the walking assistance improves gait by decreasing energy loss, and the walking resistance applies a load during walking.

AB  - Current ergonomic assessment procedures require observation and manual annotation of postures by an expert, after which ergonomic scores are inferred from these annotations. Our aim is to automate this procedure and to enable robots to optimize their behavior with respect to such scores. A particular challenge is that ergonomic scoring requires accurate biomechanical simulations which are computationally too expensive to use in robot control loops or optimization. To address this, we learn Contextual Ergonomics Models, which are Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models that have been trained with full musculoskeletal simulations for specific tasks contexts. Contextual Ergonomics Models enable search in a low-dimensional latent space, whilst the cost function can be defined in terms of the full high-dimensional musculoskeletal model, which can be quickly reconstructed from the latent space. We demonstrate how optimizing Contextual Ergonomics Models leads to significantly reduced muscle activation in an experiment with eight subjects performing a drilling task.

AB  - Machines with high levels of autonomy such as robots and our growing need to interact with them creates challenges to ensure safe operation. The recent interest to create autonomous vehicles through the integration of control and decision-making systems makes such vehicles robots too. We therefore applied estimation and decision-making mechanisms currently investigated for human-robot interaction to human-vehicle interaction. In other words, we define the vehicle as an autonomous agent with which the human driver interacts, and focus on understanding the human intentions and decision-making processes. These are then integrated into the ro-bot`s/vehicle's own control and decision-making system not only to understand human behaviour while it occurs but to predict the next actions. To obtain knowledge about the human's intentions, this work relies heavily on the use of motion tracking data (i.e. skeletal tracking, body posture)gathered from drivers whilst driving. We use a data-driven approach to both classify current driving manoeuvres and predict future manoeuvres, by using a fixed prediction window and augmenting a standard set of manoeuvres. Results are validated against drivers of different sizes, seat preferences and levels of driving expertise to evaluate the robustness of the methods; precision and recall metrics higher than 95% for manoeuvre classification and 90% for manoeuvre prediction with time-windows of up to 1.3 seconds are obtained. The idea of prediction adds a highly novel aspect to human-robot/human-vehicle interaction, allowing for decision and control at a later point.

AB  - Gaze provides subtle informative cues to aid fluent interactions among people. Incorporating human gaze predictions can signify how engaged a person is while interacting with a robot and allow the robot to predict a human's intentions or goals. We propose a novel approach to predict human gaze fixations relevant for human-robot interaction tasks-both referential and mutual gaze-in real time on a robot. We use a deep learning approach which tracks a human's gaze from a robot's perspective in real time. The approach builds on prior work which uses a deep network to predict the referential gaze of a person from a single 2D image. Our work uses an interpretable part of the network, a gaze heat map, and incorporates contextual task knowledge such as location of relevant objects, to predict referential gaze. We find that the gaze heat map statistics also capture differences between mutual and referential gaze conditions, which we use to predict whether a person is facing the robot's camera or not. We highlight the challenges of following a person's gaze on a robot in real time and show improved performance for referential gaze and mutual gaze prediction.

AB  - The most widely used methods for toolpath planning in fused deposition 3D printing slice the input model into successive 2D layers in order to construct the toolpath. Unfortunately slicing-based methods can incur a substantial amount of wasted motion (i.e., the extruder is moving while not printing), particularly when features of the model are spatially separated. In recent work we have introduced a new paradigm that constructs the toolpath in 3D and prints local features to minimize wasted motion. Our algorithm is based on a local search and we have demonstrated substantial improvements in the efficiency of the resulting toolpaths. Our approach is amenable to incorporating physical constraints of the 3D printing process, and, in this paper we extend our approach to incorporate kinematic properties into toolpath optimization. With an accurate kinematic model of the extruder, our algorithm is able to model the real-world fabrication time of the model with a high degree of accuracy. To our knowledge, this toolpath optimization algorithm is the first to encode real-world fabrication time as the objective function. We demonstrate the real-world improvement in fabrication time that is possible with our algorithm on a benchmark of almost 600 models. We find improvement in nearly every toolpath generated for our benchmark set (with a mean of 3.2%), but substantially larger improvements for some models. To rationalize these results, we introduce a metric for model characterization that we call “oriented compactness” and show that it correlates positively with our observations. We believe this metric can be an important tool in the setup of fabrication (e.g., by guiding an orientation search of the model).

AB  - Existing adaptive robot control laws typically require an engineering choice of a constant adaptation gain matrix, which often involves repeated and time-consuming trial and error. Moreover, physical consistency of the estimated inertial parameters or the uniform positive definiteness of the estimated robot mass matrix cannot in general be guaranteed without nonsmooth corrections, e.g., projection to the boundary of the feasible parameter set. In this paper we present a natural adaptive control law that mitigates many of these difficulties, by exploiting the coordinate-invariant differential geometric structure of the space of physically consistent inertial parameters. Our approach provides a more generalizable and physically consistent adaptation law for the robot parameters without significant additional computations compared to existing methods. Simulation results showing markedly improved tracking error convergence over existing adaptive control laws are provided as validation.

AB  - Making an optimal decision to avoid obstacles while heading to the goal is one of the fundamental challenges for mobile robots equipped with limited computational resources. In this paper, we present a deep imitation learning algorithm that develops a computationally efficient obstacle avoidance policy based on egocentric local occupancy maps. The trained model embedded with a variant of the value iteration networks is able to provide near-optimal continuous action commands through fast feed-forward inferences and generalize well to unseen planning-based scenarios. To improve the policy robustness, we augment the training data set with artificially generated maps, which effectively alleviates the shortage of catastrophic samples in normal demonstrations. Extensive experiments on a Segway robot show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of solution optimality, robustness as well as computation time.

AB  - This paper presents a novel wireframe map structure for resource-constrained robots operating in a rectilinear 2D environment. The wireframe representation compactly represents geometry, in addition to transient situations such as occlusions and boundaries of unexplored regions. We formulate a particle filter to suit this sparse wireframe map structure. Functions for calculating the likelihood of scans, merging wireframes, and resampling are developed to accommodate this map representation. The wireframe structure with the particle filter allows for severe discrete map errors to be corrected, leading to accurate maps with small storage requirements. We show in a simulation study that the algorithm attains a map of an environment with 1 % error, compared to an occupancy grid map obtained with GMapping which attained 23% error with the same storage requirements. A simulation mapping a large environment demonstrates the algorithms scalability.

AB  - We propose a hybrid approach aimed at improving the sample efficiency in goal-directed reinforcement learning. We do this via a two-step mechanism where firstly, we approximate a model from Model-Free reinforcement learning. Then, we leverage this approximate model along with a notion of reachability using Mean First Passage Times to perform Model-Based reinforcement learning. Built on such a novel observation, we design two new algorithms - Mean First Passage Time based Q-Learning (MFPT-Q)and Mean First Passage Time based DYNA (MFPT-DYNA), that have been fundamentally modified from the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. Preliminary results have shown that our hybrid approaches converge with much fewer iterations than their corresponding state-of-the-art counterparts and therefore requiring much fewer samples and much fewer training trials to converge.

AB  - We present an evaluation of several representative sampling-based and optimization-based motion planners, and then introduce an integrated motion planning system which incorporates recent advances in trajectory optimization into a sparse roadmap framework. Through experiments in 4 common application scenarios with 5000 test cases each, we show that optimization-based or sampling-based planners alone are not effective for realistic problems where fast planning times are required. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents such a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art motion planners, which are based on a significant amount of experiments. We then combine different stand-alone planners with trajectory optimization. The results show that the combination of our sparse roadmap and trajectory optimization provides superior performance over other standard sampling-based planners' combinations. By using a multi-query roadmap instead of generating completely new trajectories for each planning problem, our approach allows for extensions such as persistent control policy information associated with a trajectory across planning problems. Also, the sub-optimality resulting from the sparsity of roadmap, as well as the unexpected disturbances from the environment, can both be overcome by the real-time trajectory optimization process.

The paper aims to propose a shape reconstruction method and the estimation of the kinematic behavior of heterogeneous continuum robot in closed loop kinematic configuration, by using Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curves. The validation of the model approach has been tested on cooperative continuum robots, namely Compact Bionic Handling Arms (CBHA), driving an intermediate flexible rope (a passive flexible link), by using a 3D tracking system. Experimental comparison of the proposed approach with the existing approaches is performed in terms of accuracy as well as the time cost.

AB  - A number of researches have been focusing on the development and control of robots with soft structures such as flexible musculoskeletal systems. Thus far, it has been reported that these robots can achieve high adaptability to environments despite their extremely simple controllers. However, because these robots are difficult to model mathematically, there is still no systematic design policy, in which control theory has been playing a role in conventional robotics, for constituting simple controllers. To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach using a neural network to obtain mathematical models. In particular, with this method, the control theory is applied to linear system models extracted from a network trained to express the forward dynamics of a robot. Through simulations, the validity and advantage of the proposed method was successfully confirmed.

AB  - We present a robot model of early reach and grasp learning, inspired by infant learning without prior knowledge of the geometry, kinematics, or dynamics of the arm. Human infants at reach onset are capable of using a sequence of jerky submotions to bring the hand to the position of a nearby object. A robotic learning agent can produce qualitatively similar behavior by using a graph representation to encode a set of safe, potentially useful arm states and feasible moves between them. These observations show that the Peri-Personal Space (PPS) Graph model is sufficient for early reaching and suggest that infants may use analogous models during this phase. In this paper, we show that the PPS Graph, with a simulated Palmar reflex (a reflex in infants that closes the fingers when the palm is touched), allows accidental grasps to occur during continued reaching practice. Given these occasional events, the agent can bootstrap to a simple deliberate grasp action. In particular, the agent must learn three new necessary conditions for a grasp: the hand should be open as the grasp begins, the final motion of the hand should be led by the gripper opening so that it reaches the target first, and the wrist must be oriented such that the gripper fingers may close around the target object, often requiring the opening to be perpendicular to the object's major axis. Combined with the existing capability to reach and interact with target objects, knowledge of these conditions allows the agent to learn increasingly reliable purposeful grasps. The first two conditions are addressed in this paper, and allow 45% of grasps to succeed. This work contributes toward the larger goal of foundational robot learning after the model of infant learning, with minimal prior knowledge of its own anatomy or its environment. The ability to grasp will allow the agent to control the motion and position of objects, providing a richer representation for its environment and new experiences to learn from.

AB  - This paper presents a 1-link robotic arm that is antagonistically driven by one pair of a high performance super-coiled polymer actuators with an embedded controller. The actuator which is made from Spandex and nylon fibers is low-cost, easy to fabricate and light-weight. Moreover, it can generate large displacement and provide Joule heating capability. The main contribution of the paper is the model-based impedance controller, which enables position control of the antagonistic joint with variable stiffness and damping. The impedance control is a torque-based law, which in turn depends on a proposed backstepping control law to control the force of each actuator. The control system is proved to be stable using dissipativity stability theory and verified through experiments. Experimental results show that our system can track the angular position reference with the worst position error of 0.43deg and root-mean squared error of 0.16deg at steady state for sinusoidal waveform tracking (with the frequency of 0.1Hz), and the worst position error of 0.2deg for set-point regulation.

AB  - To improve the movement ability of humanoid robots, instead of traditional methods dependent on only power of actuators, there is possibility that utilizing elasticity inspired from collaboration of muscle and tendon of human is effective to achieve high-power movement. In this study, we aimed to realize a jumping motion that accumulates energy more appropriately in spring by combining active joint driving with spring behavior like human tendons and muscles. We proposed a countermovement jump method using the resonance with the leg's active pushing-off movement and leg stiffness. To achieve active pushing-off and joint stiffness, we developed a new joint mechanism using leaf springs and an actuator unit with a worm gear. We then performed experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and methods. Finally, the robot achieved a countermovement jump using active kicking and leg's elasticity.

While the aim is to make robots beneficial to humans and society, using those complex machines in complex environments will eventually lead to incidents. To enable forensic investigations, ethical evaluations and transparent function of intelligent robots in a society, we contribute the concept of a secure robot data recorder that is similar to a flight data recorder in airplanes. However, since robots work in a highly networked and uncontrolled environment, our concept pays special attention to security and tamper proofness. In addition, we extend the concept with an approach inspired by cockroaches to increase the functional integrity of the robot. We present a prototype implementation along with discussions on the required properties and limits of secure data recording.

In this work, we develop an electromagnetic-based haptic interface to provide controlled magnetic forces on a wearable orthopedic finger splint with a single magnetic dipole. We model the electromagnetic forces exerted on the finger splint, optimize the design of the electromagnetic coils, and develop an impedance-type haptic rendering algorithm using position feedback. This rendering algorithm capitalizes on minimizing the error between the exerted magnetic force and the desired constraint force of a virtual three-dimensional (3D)object based on the position of the finger splint. In order to investigate the influence of incorporating position feedback, we conduct a comparative study for the same group of participants with (Case I)and without (Case II)position feedback. Our experimental results show that position feedback enables participants to achieve success rate of 66.87 ± 15.0% (n=160) in distinguishing between the geometry of four 3D virtual objects. This rate is decreased to 55.15±15.8% (n=160) in the absence of position feedback. Our analysis shows statistical evidence to conclude that the mean success rate for Case I is greater than that of Case II, at α = 0.1 and 90% confidence level.

AB  - Programming robots for tasks involving force interaction is difficult, since both the knowledge of the task and the dynamics of the robots are necessary. An immersive haptic interface for task demonstration is proposed, where the operator can sense and act through the robot. This is achieved by coupling two robotic systems with virtual constraints such that they have the same coordinates in the operational space disregarding a fixed offset. Limitations caused by the singular configurations or the reach of the robots are naturally reflected to either side as haptic feedback.

AB  - Adapting robot actions to human motions can make human-robot interactions (HRI) more effective. Here, we aim to optimize guidance from haptic devices based on a user's response to produce better task performance. We used Gaussian processes to model the motions a human user made in response to applied torques from an ungrounded control moment gyroscope haptic device. We then used Gaussian process dynamic programming to generate optimized haptic cues to guide the user to rotate the device toward 3D targets. We compared the performance of naive and optimized policies in simulations and with a human user, and found that dynamic programming can significantly improve haptic guidance in cases where human responses are highly variable or inconsistent with the cued haptic direction.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel input device for a robotic prosthetic hand based on capacitance change. The proposed device can sense the deformation of the skin due to the activity of the muscle by measuring the capacitance change between the skin and the electrode. Therefore, it can be used as a sensor for estimating a user's intention through medical electrodiagnostic techniques such as electromyogram (EMG)and force myography (FMG). The proposed device can acquire data in a non-invasive way and is advantageous with easier data processing than that for an EMG signal. Moreover, it is resistant to the impedance change of skin because the capacitance is measured in a non-contact manner, unlike the existing methods which work with direct contact with the skin such as EMG. Additionally, unlike FMG, the device is lightly attached to the skin without being strongly fixed with velcro, which offsets problems that occur while re-wearing the device. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed idea, three of the newly developed input devices were used to classify four hand movements (fist, scissors, paper, and rest)using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). As a result, the classification success rates for the fist, paper, scissor, and rest motions were obtained as 99.3%, 98.3%, 98.4%, and 99.1%, respectively.

AB  - Decision making under uncertainty is a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex robotics scenarios. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, designed to solve this problem, was subject to much work lately. Most POMDP solvers, however, focus on planning in discrete state, action and/or observations spaces, which does not truly reflect the complexity of most real world problems. This paper addresses the issue by devising a method for solving POMDPs with continuous state, action and observations spaces. The proposed planner, Continuous Belief Tree Search (CBTS), uses Bayesian Optimisation (BO) to dynamically sample promising actions while constructing a belief tree. This dynamic sampling allows for richer action selection than offline action discretisation. CBTS is complemented by a novel trajectory generation technique, relying on the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), yielding trajectories amenable for robotics applications. The resulting trajectory planner kCBTS outperforms other continuous planners on space modelling and robot parking problems.
