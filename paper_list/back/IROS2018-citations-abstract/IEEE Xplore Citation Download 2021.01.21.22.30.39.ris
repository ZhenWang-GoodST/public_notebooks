AB  - Mobile robots are increasingly being used to assist with active pursuit and law enforcement. One major limitation for such missions is the resource (battery) allocated to the robot. Factors like nature and agility of evader, terrain over which pursuit is being carried out, plausible traversal velocity and the amount of necessary data to be collected all influence how long the robot can last in the field and how far it can travel. In this paper, we develop an analytical model that analyzes the energy utilization for a variety of components mounted on a robot to estimate the maximum operational range achievable by the robot operating on a single battery discharge. We categorize the major consumers of energy as: 1.) ancillary robotic functions such as computation, communication, sensing etc., and 2.) maneuvering which involves propulsion, steering etc. Both these consumers draw power from the common power source but the achievable range is largely affected by the proportion of power available for maneuvering. For this case study, we performed experiments with real robots on planar and graded surfaces and evaluated the estimation error for each case.

AB  - Planning for autonomous driving in complex, urban scenarios requires accurate prediction of the trajectories of surrounding traffic participants. Their future behavior depends on their route intentions, the road-geometry, traffic rules and mutual interaction, resulting in interdependencies between their trajectories. We present a probabilistic prediction framework based on a dynamic Bayesian network, which represents the state of the complete scene including all agents and respects the aforementioned dependencies. We propose Markovian, context-dependent motion models to define the interaction-aware behavior of drivers. At first, the state of the dynamic Bayesian network is estimated over time by tracking the single agents via sequential Monte Carlo inference. Secondly, we perform a probabilistic forward simulation of the network's estimated belief state to generate the different combinatorial scene developments. This provides the corresponding trajectories for the set of possible, future scenes. Our framework can handle various road layouts and number of traffic participants. We evaluate the approach in online simulations and real-world scenarios. It is shown that our interaction-aware prediction outperforms interaction-unaware physics- and map-based approaches.

AB  - In this paper, a method for dexterous manipulation of 3D soft objects for real-time deformation control is presented, relying on Finite Element modelling. The goal is to generate proper forces on the fingertips of an anthropomorphic device during in-hand manipulation to produce desired displacements of selected control points on the object. The desired motions of the fingers are computed in real-time as an inverse solution of a Finite Element Method (FEM), the forces applied by the fingertips at the contact points being modelled by Lagrange multipliers. The elasticity parameters of the model are preliminarly estimated using a vision system and a force sensor. Experimental results are shown with an underactuated anthropomorphic hand that performs a manipulation task on a soft cylindrical object.

AB  - This paper develops an adaptive gripper for peg-in-hole tasks. Conventional grippers require complicated compliant mechanisms or complicated control strategy and force sensing to successfully insert pegs into holes. Different from them, this paper proposes a simple gripper with an L-shape finger as a low-cost peg-in-hole solution. The basic idea is to divide a peg-in-hole process into a preparation phase and an execution phase, and eliminate uncertainty step-by-step by pushing using the L-shape finger in the preparation phase. The robustness of the gripper for peg-in-hole tasks is examined by repeated executions for different pegs in the International Robotic Exhibition 2017 (IREX) in Tokyo. The experimental section presents details of the executions, and qualitatively shows the high performance of the proposed gripper.

AB  - Grasp planning for multi-fingered hands is computationally expensive due to the joint-contact coupling, surface nonlinearities and high dimensionality, thus is generally not affordable for real-time implementations. Traditional planning methods by optimization, sampling or learning work well in planning for parallel grippers but remain challenging for multi-fingered hands. This paper proposes a strategy called finger splitting, to plan precision grasps for multi-fingered hands starting from optimal parallel grasps. The finger splitting is optimized by a dual-stage iterative optimization including a contact point optimization (CPO) and a palm pose optimization (PPO), to gradually split fingers and adjust both the contact points and the palm pose. The dual-stage optimization is able to consider both the object grasp quality and hand manipulability, address the nonlinearities and coupling, and achieve efficient convergence within one second. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation video is available at [1].

AB  - In recent years the topic of combining motion and symbolic planning to perform complex tasks in the field of robotics has received a lot of attention. The underlying idea is to have access at once to the reasoning capabilities of a task planner and to the ability of the motion planner to verify that the plan is feasible from a physical and geometrical point of view. The present work describes a framework to perform manipulation tasks that require the use of two robotic manipulators. To do so we employ a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner interleaved with geometric constraint verification. In this framework we also consider observation actions and handle noisy perceptions from a probabilistic perspective. These ideas are put into practice by means of an experimental set-up in which two Barrett WAM robots have to cooperatively solve a geometric puzzle. Our findings provide further evidence that considering explicitly physical constraints during task planning, rather than deferring their validation to the moment of execution, is advantageous in terms of execution time and breadth of situations that can be handled.

AB  - Humans recognize perceived continuous information by dividing it into significant segments such as words and unit motions. We believe that such unsupervised segmentation is also an important ability that robots need to learn topics such as language and motions. Hence, in this paper, we propose a method for dividing continuous time-series data into segments in an unsupervised manner. To this end, we proposed a method based on a hidden semi-Markov model with Gaussian process (GP-HSMM). If Gaussian processes, which are nonparametric models, are used, unit motion patterns can be extracted from complicated continuous motion. However, this approach requires the number of classes of segments in the time-series data in advance. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we extend GP-HSMM to a nonparametric Bayesian model by introducing a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) and propose the hierarchical Dirichlet processes-Gaussian process-hidden semi-Markov model (HDP-GP-HSMM). In the nonparametric Bayesian model, an infinite number of classes is assumed and it becomes difficult to estimate the parameters naively. Instead, the parameters of the proposed HDP-GP-HSMM are estimated by applying slice sampling. In the experiments, we use various synthetic and motion-capture data to show that our proposed model can estimate a more correct number of classes and achieve more accurate segmentation than baseline methods.

AB  - We present a fast and very effective method for object classification that is particularly suited for robotic applications such as grasping and semantic mapping. Our approach is based on a Random Forest classifier that can be trained incrementally. This has the major benefit that semantic information from new data samples can be incorporated without retraining the entire model. Even if new samples from a previously unseen class are presented, our method is able to perform efficient updates and learn a sustainable representation for this new class. Further features of our method include a very fast and memory-efficient implementation, as well as the ability to interrupt the learning process at any time without a significant performance degradation. Experiments on benchmark data for robotic applications show the clear benefits of our incremental approach and its competitiveness with standard offline methods in terms of classification accuracy.

AB  - The predictive functions that permit humans to infer their body state by sensorimotor integration are critical to perform safe interaction in complex environments. These functions are adaptive and robust to non-linear actuators and noisy sensory information. This paper introduces a computational perceptual model based on predictive processing that enables any multisensory robot to learn, infer and update its body configuration when using arbitrary sensors with Gaussian additive noise. The proposed method integrates different sources of information (tactile, visual and proprioceptive) to drive the robot belief to its current body configuration. The motivation is to provide robots with the embodied perception needed for self-calibration and safe physical human-robot interaction. We formulate body learning as obtaining the forward model that encodes the sensor values depending on the body variables, and we solve it by Gaussian process regression. We model body estimation as minimizing the discrepancy between the robot body configuration belief and the observed posterior. We minimize the variational free energy using the sensory prediction errors (sensed vs expected). In order to evaluate the model we test it on a real multi-sensory robotic arm. We show how different sensor modalities contributions, included as additive errors, improve the refinement of the body estimation and how the system adapts itself to provide the most plausible solution even when injecting strong sensory visuo-tactile perturbations. We further analyse the reliability of the model when different sensor modalities are disabled. This provides grounded evidence about the correctness of the perceptual model and shows how the robot estimates and adjusts its body configuration just by means of sensory information.

AB  - How can high dimensional robots learn general sets of skills from experience in the real world? Many previous approaches focus on maximizing a single utility function and require large datasets of experience to do this, something that is not possible to collect outside of simulation as every data point is expensive both in time and in a potential wear down of the robot. This paper addresses this question using a newly developed framework called Finite Element Goal Babbling (FEGB). FEGB is an online learning method that aims at providing general control over some measurable feature, in contrast to optimizing it to some given utility function. It generalizes standard goal babbling by breaking down the full learning problem into local sub-problems, and combining it with a planner that learns how to navigate between these subproblems. We test FEGB using a real humanoid robot Nao, and find that it could quickly learn to robustly control its body orientation. After only 20-30 minutes of training, the robot could freely move into any body orientation between lying on either side and on its back. Rapid learning of body orientation control in high dimensional real robots is largely an unexplored field of robotics, and although many challenges remain, FEGB shows a feasible approach to the problem.

AB  - Decentralized receding horizon control (D-RHC) provides a mechanism for coordination in multiagent settings without a centralized command center. However, combining a set of different goals, costs, and constraints to form an efficient optimization objective for D-RHC can be difficult. To allay this problem, we use a meta-learning process - cost adaptation - which generates the optimization objective for D-RHC to solve based on a set of human-generated priors (cost and constraint functions) and an auxiliary heuristic. We use this adaptive D-RHC method for control of mesh-networked swarm agents. This formulation allows a wide range of tasks to be encoded and can account for network delays, heterogeneous capabilities, and increasingly large swarms through the adaptation mechanism. We leverage the Unity3D game engine to build a simulator capable of introducing artificial networking failures and delays in the swarm. Using the simulator we validate our method on an example coordinated exploration task. We demonstrate that cost adaptation allows for more efficient and safer task completion under varying environment conditions and increasingly large swarm sizes. We release our simulator and code to the community for future work.

AB  - The objective of this work is to augment the basic abilities of a robot by learning to use new sensorimotor primitives to enable the solution of complex long-horizon problems. Solving long-horizon problems in complex domains requires flexible generative planning that can combine primitive abilities in novel combinations to solve problems as they arise in the world. In order to plan to combine primitive actions, we must have models of the preconditions and effects of those actions: under what circumstances will executing this primitive achieve some particular effect in the world? We use, and develop novel improvements on, state-of-the-art methods for active learning and sampling. We use Gaussian process methods for learning the conditions of operator effectiveness from small numbers of expensive training examples collected by experimentation on a robot. We develop adaptive sampling methods for generating diverse elements of continuous sets (such as robot configurations and object poses) during planning for solving a new task, so that planning is as efficient as possible. We demonstrate these methods in an integrated system, combining newly learned models with an efficient continuous-space robot task and motion planner to learn to solve long horizon problems more efficiently than was previously possible.

AB  - Reinforcement learning has been very successful at learning control policies for robotic agents in order to perform various tasks, such as driving around a track, navigating a maze, and bipedal locomotion. One significant drawback of reinforcement learning methods is that they require a large number of data points in order to learn good policies, a trait known as poor data efficiency or poor sample efficiency. One approach for improving sample efficiency is supervised pre-training of policies to directly clone the behavior of an expert, but this suffers from poor generalization far from the training data. We propose to improve this by using Gaussian dropout networks with a regularization term based on variational inference in the pre-training step. We show that this initializes policy parameters to significantly better values than standard supervised learning or random initialization, thus greatly reducing sample complexity compared with state-of-the-art methods, and enabling an RL algorithm to learn optimal policies for high-dimensional continuous control problems in a practical time frame.

AB  - In this work, we introduce a framework for performing dexterous manipulations on the humanoid robot Robonaut-2. This framework memorizes how actions change perceptions and can learn a sequence of actions based on demonstrations. With the anthropomorphic Robonaut-2 hand and arm, a variety of manipulation tasks such as grasping novel objects, rotating a drill for grasping, and tightening a bolt with a ratchet can be accomplished. This framework was also used to compete in the IROS2018 Fan Robotic Challenge that requires manipulating a hand fan and was a winner of the phase I modality A competition.

AB  - The 2018 IROS Fan Robotic Challenge tasked participants with programming a robot to autonomously open and close a Spanish folding fan, highlighting the obstacles still associated with the dexterous manipulation of objects for robotic systems. Since high DoFs grippers are complex to coordinate and overkill for many industrial processes, our approach used an under-actuated parallel gripper with a 3D-printed adaptation to precisely grasp the fan in such a manner that gravity could be leveraged to act on the fan to produce an extrinsic, or external, dexterity. With our approach, we completed the challenge in 12.38 seconds, resulting in a top three finish. Furthermore, using a multi-modal tactile sensor, we analyzed the vibrations in the grasp during the manipulation and were able to distinguish the opening and closing of the fan from the motion of the robot with a 83% accuracy.

AB  - In this paper, a dual-arm robot system for high-speed manipulations, which is named LIMS2-AMBIDEX and is developed to compete in the IROS2018 Robotic Challenge, is presented. It has two seven-degrees-of-freedom (DO F) lightweight arms, a three-DOF head, and a one-DOF gripper to manipulate foldable objects. Because all the heavy actuators are placed at the shoulder, it has remarkably low mass beyond the shoulder (2.63 kg), which guarantees an inherent safety at high speeds. Utilizing tension-amplification mechanisms, the high stiffness and strength are achieved, and thus it has the control performance comparable to conventional industrial manipulators. A unique three-DOF wrist mechanism, whose motions directly represent the quaternion values of the joint orientation, can manipulate objects without singular points in the entire range of motion. In order to utilize the object's inertia during rapid manipulation, the gripper was specially designed: it has a one-DOF finger to grasp the upper rib of the foldable fan and two supporting forks to grasp the bottom rib stably. For real-time performance and increased scalability, a software framework was developed based on Robot Operating System (ROS). The real-time capability is achieved by using the real-time development framework Xenomai and the high-speed communication protocol EtherCAT. As most of the algorithms are implemented in the distributed nodes using ROS, it is convenient to expand, improve, and replace the algorithms. Consequentially, the entire motion of the Fan Robotic Challenge Phase I Modality B required 1.05 s, which is substantially faster than a similar manipulation by most humans.

AB  - A Spanish fan is a hand held traditional fan which is used as an accessory and also by Flamenco dancers. The manipulation of the fan is quite difficult as it involves dynamic motion which includes opening, flapping and closing the fan along a pivotal point. The key points include the motion to be quick and the fan to be opened to the maximum degree possible without human intervention. A robotic arm with 7 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) is used to manipulate the autonomous motion. The fan placed on the table is localized and detected using a camera by background subtraction, masking and filtering; post which the contour of the fan is detected. The pixels obtained is then transformed into real life coordinates. The Dynamixel motors then traverses to the coordinates of the fan's position to grasp, open, flap, close and put the fan down.

AB  - This paper presents a novel quadcopter design with an added momentum wheel for enhanced stability. The novel vehicle has improved torque disturbance rejection capabilities compared to a standard quadcopter. An analysis of the vehicle dynamics shows that the effect of torque disturbances decreases monotonically with increasing angular momentum of the momentum wheel. A framework for choosing the mass moment of inertia and speed of the momentum wheel is given based on an upper bound on the allowable energy stored in the wheel. Theoretical results are experimentally validated by comparing responses to torque impulses applied to the vehicle with and without the momentum wheel spinning.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in a wide range of applications, including many military and civilian uses. State of the art control strategies for these vehicles are typically limited to a portion of the vehicle's flight envelope, and are tailored to a specific type of platform. This article presents a single physics-based controller capable of aggressive maneuvering for the majority of UAVs. The controller is applicable to UAVs with the ability to apply a force along a body-fixed direction, and a moment about an arbitrary axis, which includes UAVs such as multi-copters, conventional fixed-wing, agile fixed-wing, flying-wing with two thrusters, most tailsitters, and some tilt-rotor/wing platforms. We demonstrate autonomous flight for a quadrotor and agile fixed-wing aircraft in a simulation environment. To specifically demonstrate the extreme maneuvering capability of the control logic, we perform a rolling flip with the quadrotor and an aggressive turnaround with the fixed-wing aircraft, all using a single controller with a single set of gains.

AB  - This paper presents a passive compliance control for aerial manipulators to achieve stable environmental interactions. The main challenge is the absence of actuation along body-planar directions of the aerial vehicle which might be required during the interaction to preserve passivity. The controller proposed in this paper guarantees passivity of the manipulator through a proper choice of end-effector coordinates, and that of vehicle fuselage is guaranteed by exploiting time domain passivity technique. Simulation studies validate the proposed approach.

AB  - We consider pursuit-evasion games in which the pursuer is tasked with intercepting the evader using only partial measurements. Motivated by the utilization of visual sensing on board the pursuer, we focus on the case when only bearing measurements are available to the pursuer. The resulting partially-observable interception problem is computationally challenging, and the separation principle does not hold in general. In this paper, we identify a set of maneuvers that improve observability, and we propose an algorithm that utilizes these maneuvers to move the pursuer so that the expected payoff of the differential game is maximized. The algorithm uses in-the-loop uncertainty propagation based on linear covariance analysis to assess the effect of the maneuvers. We evaluate the resulting guidance law in experiments involving a quadcopter in flight representing the pursuer, and a simulated evader.

The control system obtained is validated both in simulation and experimentally, resorting to an off-the-shelf commercially available quadrotor equipped with an IMU, an ultrasound height sensor, and a barometer, among other sensors.

AB  - A provably stable decentralized control scheme is proposed to allow multiple conventional quadcopters carry a cable-suspended payload. The method exploits a fundamental energetic passivity property of the combined drones, cables, and payload system to stably move the payload from its origin to destination. This is achieved without making any assumption about the status of the cables tension during the flight, and any measurement from the payload. The controller is decentralized in the sense that inter-drone communication of feedback measurements is not required. Motion stability is demonstrated via a Lyapunov analysis. The proposed controller is successfully implemented on a three-drone payload transport system in an indoor environment, using measurement from an optical tracking systems and the drones on-board IMUs.

AB  - We propose a novel interaction strategy for a human-swarm communication when a human operator guides a formation of quadrotors with impedance control and receives vibrotactile feedback. The presented approach takes into account the human hand velocity and changes the formation shape and dynamics accordingly using impedance interlinks simulated between quadrotors, which helps to achieve a life-like swarm behavior. Experimental results with Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor platform validate the proposed control algorithm. The tactile patterns representing dynamics of the swarm (extension or contraction) are proposed. The user feels the state of the swarm at his fingertips and receives valuable information to improve the controllability of the complex life-like formation. The user study revealed the patterns with high recognition rates. Subjects stated that tactile sensation improves the ability to guide the drone formation and makes the human-swarm communication much more interactive. The proposed technology can potentially have a strong impact on the human-swarm interaction, providing a new level of intuitiveness and immersion into the swarm navigation.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel aerial manipulator with tandem ducted fans, which takes both trafficability and effective loading into account. The aerial manipulator is particularly suitable for grasping in complex and narrow environment, in which traditional multi-rotor and helicopter would be inaccessible. The comprehensive integrated dynamic model is established by taking the aerial vehicle dynamics and manipulator dynamics as a whole. On this basis, a multilayer composite controller with feedforward compensation is designed, considering the mutual reactive influence between the aerial vehicle and the manipulator to improve the stability of the system under the motion of the manipulator. The simulation and actual flight tests verify the effectiveness of the design and show good stability and tracking performance of the system.

AB  - Typical autonomous robotics systems incorporate multiple cameras, LIDAR sensors and sophisticated computing resources. In this paper we present a software framework for utilizing any array of multiple cameras with sufficient field-of-view (FOV) overlap as a light field imaging system. We show that the typical linear arrays that exist on autonomous cars are sufficient to capture stable time resolved light fields even when moving at highway speeds. We elaborate on the potential pitfalls associated with such a technique namely loss of calibration between cameras due to high frequency vibrations and sudden shocks associated with driving over potholes and highlight a method that can compensate for such effects. We demonstrate that the light fields collected by simple linear arrays can be processed in real time for a wide variety of useful applications including occlusion removal, for signal enhancement in featureless images captured in very low light, for reflection removal and for improved visibility in extreme conditions associated with snow and heavy rain.

AB  - This paper discusses video motion capture, namely, 3D reconstruction of human motion from multi-camera images. After the Part Confidence Maps are computed from each camera image, the proposed spatiotemporal filter is applied to deliver the human motion data with accuracy and smoothness for human motion analysis. The spatiotemporal filter uses the human skeleton and mixes temporal smoothing in two-time inverse kinematics computations. The experimental results show that the mean per joint position error was 26.1mm for regular motions and 38.8mm for inverted motions.

AB  - This paper presents a high-quality wide-angle fovea lens, i.e., the WAF lens, for the autonomous robot's and vehicle's super-sensing vision system. The WAF lens is well-known in the field of robotic vision with respect to its unique design concept, biologically-inspired from a visual system of the primates. The WAF lens achieves the following two conflicting properties in imaging simultaneously: (1) wide field of view (FOV) and (2) high magnification factor (although only the central FOV achieves it partially). In this paper, the authors designs the WAF lens for the high-resolution photosensitive imaging chip more than 3M pixels. For this design, we decide the following targets on the assumption of applying this WAF lens for the stereo vision system: (1) The WAF lens can measure a very far distance over 100m ahead from the imager accurately. (2) The WAF lens can observe approximately 100-degree wide FOV on the same time. We produce a prototype of this WAF lens with much higher optical performance than our previous developments. The compound system of the prototype includes four aspherical surfaces in its front part to project enough bright images so that the WAF lens is available not only at daytime but also in dark situations at night. The authors experiment and demonstrate the projection tests using the prototype, and discuss about the results as the inspection of this challenging development.

AB  - Skilled robotic manipulation benefits from complex synergies between non-prehensile (e.g. pushing) and prehensile (e.g. grasping) actions: pushing can help rearrange cluttered objects to make space for arms and fingers; likewise, grasping can help displace objects to make pushing movements more precise and collision-free. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to discover and learn these synergies from scratch through model-free deep reinforcement learning. Our method involves training two fully convolutional networks that map from visual observations to actions: one infers the utility of pushes for a dense pixel-wise sampling of end-effector orientations and locations, while the other does the same for grasping. Both networks are trained jointly in a Q-learning framework and are entirely self-supervised by trial and error, where rewards are provided from successful grasps. In this way, our policy learns pushing motions that enable future grasps, while learning grasps that can leverage past pushes. During picking experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we find that our system quickly learns complex behaviors even amid challenging cases of tightly packed clutter, and achieves better grasping success rates and picking efficiencies than baseline alternatives after a few hours of training. We further demonstrate that our method is capable of generalizing to novel objects.

AB  - By briefly heating the local environment with a heat lamp and observing what happens with a thermal camera, robots could potentially infer properties of their surroundings. However, this form of active thermography introduces large signal variations compared to traditional active thermography, which has typically been used to characterize small regions of materials in carefully controlled settings. We demonstrate that a data-driven approach with modern machine learning methods can be used to classify material samples over relatively large surface areas and variable distances. We also introduce the use of z-normalization to improve material classification and reduce variation due to distance and heating intensity. Our best performing algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 77.7% for multi-class classification among 12 materials placed at varying distances (20 cm, 30 cm, and 40 cm). The observations were made for 5 seconds with 1s of heating and 4s of cooling. We also provide a demonstration of performance with a multi-material scene.

AB  - Most existing trajectory tracking controllers are based on non-skidding and non-slipping assumptions, also assume that full states are accessible, which is unrealistic for real-world applications due to tire-road interaction. This paper presents a novel vision-based approach to achieve high performance tracking control of a Car-Like Mobile Robot (CLMR) with wheel skidding and slippage. A visual estimation algorithm is proposed to provide reliable position, velocity, skidding and slipping information to close the control loop. The stability of the proposed system can be guaranteed by Lyapunov method since the position tracking error and the estimation error converge to zero simultaneously. Simulation is made to validate the effectiveness of the developed controller in the presence of skidding and slipping with online visual estimator.

Swarms of five e-puck robots are used in a semi-virtual environment, facilitated by the VICON positioning system. This setup allows us to control the amount of noise in the robot positioning data and to generate pseudo-random environments, while retaining important physical aspects of the experiment. The effect of inherent noise in the robot infra-red sensors, used for obstacle avoidance, is noted and the importance of modelling such noise in agent-based simulations is highlighted.

AB  - Self-assembly is the aggregation of simple parts into complex patterns as frequently observed in nature. Following this inspiration, creating programmable systems of self-assembly that achieve similar complexity and robustness with robots is challenging. As a role model we pick the growth of natural plants that adapts to environmental conditions and is robust enough to withstand disturbances such as changes due to dynamic environments and cut parts. We program a robot swarm to self-assemble into tree-like shapes and to adapt efficiently to the environment. Our approach is inspired by the vascular morphogenesis of plants, the patterned formation of vascular tissue to transport fluids and nutrients internally. The aggregated robots establish an internal network of resource sharing, allowing them to make rational decisions collectively about where to add and where to remove robots. As a result, the growth is adaptive to an environmental feature (here, light) and robust to changes in a dynamic environment. The robot swarm is able to self-repair by regrowing lost parts. We successfully validate and benchmark our approach in a number of robot swarm experiments showing adaptivity, robustness, and self-repair.

We investigated the impact of pheromone-based communication on the efficiency of robotic swarms to locate and aggregate at areas with a given cue. In particular, we evaluated the impact of the pheromone evaporation and diffusion on the time required for the swarm to aggregate. In a series of simulated and real-world evaluation trials, we demonstrated that augmenting the BEECLUST method with artificial pheromone resulted in faster aggregation times.

Our approach tackles scenarios in which the swarm must reach multiple spatially distributed targets, and enforce the constraint that the robot network cannot be split. The basic idea behind our work is to construct a logical tree topology over the physical network formed by the robots. The logical tree acts as a backbone used by robots to enforce connectivity constraints. We study and compare two algorithms to form the logical tree: outwards and inwards. These algorithms differ in the order in which the robots join the tree: the outwards algorithm starts at the tree root and grows towards the targets, while the inwards algorithm proceeds in the opposite manner. Both algorithms perform periodic reconfiguration, to prevent suboptimal topologies from halting the growth of the tree. Our contributions are (i) The formulation of the two algorithms; (ii) A comparison of the algorithms in extensive physics-based simulations; (iii) A validation of our findings through real-robot experiments.

AB  - In this work we consider a swarm of agents shaped as bars with a certain orientation in the state space. Members of the swarm have to reach an aggregate state, while guaranteeing the collision avoidance and possibly achieving an angular consensus. By relying on a segment-to-segment distance definition, we propose a control law, which guides the agents towards this goal. A theoretical analysis of the proposed control scheme along with simulations and experimental results is provided. The proposed framework can be used to model several application scenarios ranging from collaborative transportation to precision farming, where each agent may represent either a large robot or a group of robots intent to carry bar-like shaped loads. Representative examples include: a fleet of robot-teams performing a collaborative object transportation task in an automated logistic setting, or a fleet of autonomous tractors each carrying a large atomizer to spray chemical products for pest and disease control in a precision farming setting.

AB  - Applications of safety, security, and rescue in robotics, such as multi-robot target tracking, involve the execution of information acquisition tasks by teams of mobile robots. However, in failure-prone or adversarial environments, robots get attacked, their communication channels get jammed, and their sensors may fail, resulting in the withdrawal of robots from the collective task, and consequently the inability of the remaining active robots to coordinate with each other. As a result, traditional design paradigms become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient designs against system-wide failures and attacks become important. In general, resilient design problems are hard, and even though they often involve objective functions that are monotone or submodular, scalable approximation algorithms for their solution have been hitherto unknown. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm, enabling the following capabilities: minimal communication, i.e., the algorithm is executed by the robots based only on minimal communication between them; system-wide resiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks and failures; and provable approximation performance, i.e., the algorithm ensures for all monotone (and not necessarily submodular) objective functions a solution that is finitely close to the optimal. We quantify our algorithms approximation performance using a notion of curvature for monotone set functions. We support our theoretical analyses with simulated and real-world experiments, by considering an active information gathering scenario, namely, multi-robot target tracking.

We demonstrate the feasibility of such a solution using physics-based simulations to synthesize a policy in a computationally-efficient manner and exhibit superior performance with regards to the minimization of probability of mission failure when compared to two feasible baseline approaches. Furthermore, we present preliminary results that suggest our approach is robust to errors in the state estimation used to build mission context, which further supports the notion of real-world applicability.

AB  - Reach-avoid problems involve driving a system to a set of desirable configurations while keeping it away from undesirable ones. Providing mathematical guarantees for such scenarios is challenging but have numerous potential practical applications. Due to the challenges, analysis of reach-avoid problems involves making trade-offs between generality of system dynamics, generality of problem setups, optimality of solutions, and computational complexity. In this paper, we combine sum-of-squares optimization and dynamic programming to address the reach-avoid problem, and provide a conservative solution that maintains reaching and avoidance guarantees. Our method is applicable to polynomial system dynamics and to general problem setups, and is more computationally scalable than previous related methods. Through a numerical example involving two single integrators, we validate our proposed theory and compare our method to Hamilton-Jacobi reachability. Having validated our theory, we demonstrate the computational scalability of our method by computing the reach-avoid set of a system involving two kinematic cars.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method for generating level-ground walking for a rimless wheel with a controlled wobbling mass. Our rimless wheel achieves level-ground walking by simply controlling the wobbling mass attached to the wheel. We mathematically demonstrate that the controlled wobbling mass generates propulsive effects for the rimless wheel. The walking speed of the rimless wheel can be changed by varying the amplitude of the wobbling mass: thus slow walking to high-speed walking can be realized for the wheel. Moreover, we have developed a robot based on a rimless wheel to show effectiveness of our proposed methods. We then analyze the walking properties with respect to the physical parameters and control parameters of our robot through numerical simulation.

This, combined with the application of an asymmetric configuration of the rear legs enables strafing motions and thus dynamic maneuverability on walls in the vertical domain.

AB  - We present the design of a new robotic human augmentation system that will assist the operator in carrying a heavy payload, reaching and maintaining difficult postures, and ultimately better performing their job. The Extra Robotic Legs (XRL) system is worn by the operator and consists of two articulated robotic legs that move with the operator to bear a heavy payload. The design was driven by a need to increase the effectiveness of hazardous material emergency response personnel who are encumbered by their personal protective equipment (PPE). The legs will ultimately walk, climb stairs, crouch down, and crawl with the operator while eliminating all external PPE loads on the operator. The forces involved in the most extreme loading cases were analyzed to find an effective strategy for reducing actuator loads. The analysis reveals that the maximum torque is exerted during the transition from the crawling to standing mode of motion. Peak torques are significantly reduced by leveraging redundancy in force application resulting from a closed-loop kinematic chain formed by a particular posture of the XRL. The actuators, power systems, and transmission elements were designed from the results of these analyses. Using differential mechanisms to combine the inputs of multiple actuators into a single degree of freedom, the gear reductions needed to bear the heavy loads could be kept at a minimum, enabling high bandwidth force control due to the near-direct-drive transmission. A prototype was fabricated utilizing the insights gained from these analyses and initial tests indicate the feasibility of the XRL system.

AB  - This paper presents a technique to model statically indeterminate forces based on stiffness matrices for multi-limbed climbing robots. Current wall climbing robots in literature overlook statically indeterminate forces, causing an incapability to estimate climbing failure under certain circumstances. Accounting for these forces, robot deformation can be approximated, paving the way for the proposed two-wall climbing approach. During a wall climb, two failure modes, slide and over-torque, are identified to compute feasible climbing region. A hexapod robot is used to verify the proposed technique by climbing between walls with pure friction end effectors.

Lack of actuation at ankles is a disadvantage in the fast walking of PAWs. We started this study with an intuitive hypothesis that rhythmic sway of torso may enable faster walking in PAWs. To test this hypothesis, firstly, we optimized the rhythmic sway of torso of a simulated PAW model for fast walking speed, and analyzed the robustness of the optimal trajectories. Then we implemented the optimal trajectories on a real robot. Both the simulation analysis and the experimental results indicated that optimized torso-swaying can greatly increase the walking speed by 40%. By analyzing the walking patterns of the simulated model and the real robot, we identified the reason for the faster walking with swaying-torso: The rhythmic sway of torso enables the robot to walk with a relatively large step-length while still keeninu a hizh sten-frenuencv.

AB  - Biped robots have not achieved the efficient and harmonious locomotion of the human beings, capable of walking and running on unstructured terrains, with obstacles, holes and slopes. With this in mind, researchers started the development of biomimetic solutions to control the locomotion of biped models. This work presents a new solution of motion control of bipedal robots with adaptable stiffness, by exploring effects of joint stiffness in modulating walking behavior. Further, torque adjustment is achieved through a biomimetic controller that mimics and adjusts the natural dynamics of the robot to the environment. Specifically, the torque adjustment is made using AFOs (adaptive frequency oscillator) to generate the correct equilibrium positions that will be applied to the impedance control that computes the torque of each joint. Results show that the biped model is capable of walking in several types of terrain, including flat terrain, ramps, stairs and flat terrain with obstacles.

AB  - Stealth walking is a way of walking carefully and noiselessly, and is an approach to stable legged locomotion of underactuated robotic walkers on irregular terrains. This paper proposes a method for generating a high-speed stealth walking gait without including double-limb support phase, and discusses the effect of upper-body control and semicircular feet on the gait properties. First, we introduce a model of a 3-link planar underactuated biped with an upper body and semicircular feet, and derive the approximate target initial state of the upper body by using the linearized equation of motion. Second, we conduct numerical simulations of the nonlinear model to observe the typical stealth walking gaits, and analyze the changing tendency of the upper body motion with respect to the foot radius. Furthermore, we discuss the advantage of semicircular feet through parametric studies of the gait efficiencies.

AB  - In Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery (MIRS) a robot is interposed between the surgeon and the surgical site to increase the precision, dexterity, and to reduce surgeon's effort and cognitive load with respect to the standard laparoscopic interventions. However, the modern robotic systems for MIRS are still based on the traditional telemanipulation paradigm, e.g. the robot behaviour is fully under surgeon's control, and no autonomy or assistance is implemented. In this work, supervised and shared controllers have been developed in a vision-free, human-in-the-Ioop, control framework to help surgeon during a surgical suturing procedure. Experiments conducted on the da Vinci Research Kit robot proves the effectiveness of the method indicating also the guidelines for improving results.

AB  - This paper describes a novel sensorless force estimation algorithm for the rigid link parallel wrist mechanism of a robotic surgical instrument. The method utilizes novel reaction force observers (RFOB) in joint space, which are modified disturbance observers (DOB) combined with Neural Networks (NN) for inverse dynamics calculations, to estimate external forces acting on the motors. External force/torque estimation in Cartesian space is achieved by the use of the robot Jacobian. The proposed algorithm is applicable to any back-drivable rigid-link wrist mechanism without the need for force sensors. In this paper, the method is implemented on a novel 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel robotic surgical wrist mechanism that is designed for high dexterity (±90 degrees pitch-yaw rotations, thrust motion) and force/torque estimation. The wrist is actuated extracorporally with 3 rigid push-pull rods and 3 linear motors. With a rigid transmission and high back-drivability, external force/torque estimation can be achieved from the motor position readings utilizing the proposed method. Several experiments were performed on the manufactured prototype of the instrument and results validate the efficacy of the wrist and estimation method with RMS force/torque estimation error values of 0.0024 Nm in pitch axis, 0.0043 Nm in yaw axis and 0.1866 N in thrust axis.

AB  - This paper presents measurements of human hand-impedance during a laparoscopic training program with physically interactive robotic manipulators. The knowledge of how the hand-impedance changes due to training might be useful to inform better training programs and to introduce co-manipulated robotic assistants for effective trainings. Ten novice subjects participated in a three weeks training program for a suturing activity in laparoscopy. The subjects have been instructed to set the needle, enter the skin, and tie knots by using laparoscopic tools within a Minimally Invasive Surgery training box. Variable admittance controlled robots, attached to the tools with force sensors, applied step vice velocity disturbances while subjects were trying to set the needle. Based on the interaction force and end-effector position information, impedances of the left and right hands were computed in four different directions. The computed results were compared with respect to the participants skill progression.

AB  - 3D reconstruction and surgical tool segmentation are necessary for several advanced tasks in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. These tasks include vision-based force estimation, surgical guidance, and medical image registration where pre-operative data (CT or MRI scan image slices) are overlaid on patient anatomy in real-time during surgery [1] to name a few. In this work, two main strategies were considered: (1) initialize with surgical tool segmentation from 2D images, then proceed to local 3D reconstruction near the tool-tissue interaction region by projecting the segmented result into 3D space, and (2) initialize with 3D reconstruction of the entire surgical task space, followed by surgical tool segmentation from within the 3D reconstructed model. Both methods were implemented on the Raven II surgical robot system, and accuracy and time complexity for both methods were comparatively analyzed while considering various task parameters. Finally, based on the results of this work, guidelines for selecting reconstruction and segmentation strategies and procedure for particular situations are outlined in Section V.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the method and implementation of a real-time tumor tracking system for a pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy system. PBS is an advanced cancer treatment system that can benefit from precise localization of the tumors through motion. We utilize techniques such as cross-correlation matching, correlation filters and small object saliency, creating an array of methods that can detect and track fiducial markers implanted in the cancer tumors. The final aim is to control the proton beam using real-time image guidance. Our technique works robustly on various types of markers such as ceramic/metallic fiducials, visicoil markers and surgical clips. Left and right views of an X-ray fluoroscopy system were utilized to also triangulate the marker positions in full 3D as they are tracked through normal breathing movement and organ motion. We have tested our detection system on data from several patients with different tumor locations both offline and in real-time and wish to implement it within a full treatment system soon. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first real time tracking system for PBS therapy that is applicable for various types of fiducials and tumor locations.

AB  - Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) aims to develop robots that provide assistance to human workers while performing physical tasks. Such assistance comes in the form of supportive behaviors that are different from the actions part of the task, and that are meant to help a human worker more effectively accomplish the task. Learning how to provide useful behaviors that are tailored to a human peer represents a difficult challenge. This is due to the need of large amounts of training data in the form of real world observations that include information about such preferences. This data needs to encode not only the structure and progression of the task, but also the different workers' preferences with respect to when and what assistance the robot should provide. Our work separates the challenge of learning a model of the task (which requires a large amount of training data) from that of learning supportive behavior preferences for the interaction (which has obvious restrictions for the number of user-provided demonstrations to which we have access). We first learn a hidden Markov model (HMM) from a training set consisting of observed human workers performing the considered task in simulation. We then use this model to predict, while observing the human peer, what supportive behaviors a robot should offer throughout the task. Building upon the hidden state representation, our system is able to learn the supportive behaviors based on as few as five user-annotated demonstrations, learning a personalized supportive behavior model. We evaluate our system on a user study with 14 participants, and show results on par with human-level prediction for the task.

AB  - Driving is a social activity: drivers often indicate their intent to change lanes via motion cues. We consider mixed-autonomy traffic where a Human-driven Vehicle (HV) and an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) drive together. We propose a planning framework where the degree to which the AV considers the other agent's reward is controlled by a selfishness factor. We test our approach on a simulated two-lane highway where the AV and HV merge into each other's lanes. In a user study with 21 subjects and 6 different selfishness factors, we found that our planning approach was sound and that both agents had less merging times when a factor that balances the rewards for the two agents was chosen. Our results on double lane merging suggest it to be a non-zero-sum game and encourage further investigation on collaborative decision making algorithms for mixed-autonomy traffic.

AB  - Interaction of socially assistive robots with users is based on social cues coming from different interaction modalities, such as speech or gestures. However, using all modalities at all times may be inefficient as it can overload the user with redundant information and increase the task completion time. Additionally, users may favor certain modalities over the other as a result of their disability or personal preference. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Modality Selection (AMS) algorithm that chooses modalities depending on the state of the user and the environment, as well as user preferences. The variables that describe the environment and the user state are defined as resources, and we posit that modalities are successful if certain resources possess specific values during their use. Besides the resources, the proposed algorithm takes into account user preferences which it learns while interacting with users. We tested our algorithm in simulations, and we implemented it on a robotic system that provides cognitive training, specifically Sequential memory exercises. Experimental results show that it is possible to use only a subset of available modalities without compromising the interaction. Moreover, we see a trend for users to perform better when interacting with a system with implemented AMS algorithm.

AB  - The brain-machine interface (BMI) has been reported to offer the potential for controlling the assistive robot for the motor impaired people, using the non-invasively obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the EEG based BMI may not be sufficient and stable to drive the robot moving freely in its 2D or 3D workspace. The robot autonomy may provide assistance for the BMI users with the shared control paradigm. Nevertheless, users suffers from several limitations of the current shared control paradigms applied on BMI, e.g., loss of sense of control, high mental workload due to unintuitive control with the human-robot interface and fixed level of assistance. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new control paradigm for the robotic arm reaching task where the robot autonomy is dynamically blended with the gaze-BMI control from a user. In this paradigm, the hybrid gaze-BMI constitutes an intuitive and effective input to continuously control the robotic arm end-effector moving freely in its 2D workspace, with an adjustable speed proportional to the motion intention strength. Furthermore, the adjustable level of assistance by our paradigm allows the system to balance the user's capabilities and feelings of control while compensating for the reaching task's difficulty. The proposed paradigm is verified in the task where a healthy subject utilizes the hybrid gaze-BMI to control the robotic arm end-effector reaching for a target object while avoiding the obstacle in the path. The experimental results demonstrate that the movements with our shared control paradigm are safer, more efficient and less difficult than those without shared control.

AB  - We present a real-time, data-driven algorithm to enhance the social-invisibility of robots within crowds. Our approach is based on prior psychological research, which reveals that people notice and-importantly-react negatively to groups of social actors when they have high entitativity, moving in a tight group with similar appearances and trajectories. In order to evaluate that behavior, we performed a user study to develop navigational algorithms that minimize entitativity. This study establishes mapping between emotional reactions and multi-robot trajectories and appearances, and further generalizes the finding across various environmental conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of our entitativity modeling for trajectory computation for active surveillance and dynamic intervention in simulated robot-human interaction scenarios. Our approach empirically shows that various levels of entitative robots can be used to both avoid and influence pedestrians while not eliciting strong emotional reactions, giving multi-robot systems socially-invisibility.

AB  - Recent advances in mixed-reality technologies have renewed interest in alternative modes of communication for human-robot interaction. However, most of the work in this direction has been confined to tasks such as teleoperation, simulation or explication of individual actions of a robot. In this paper, we will discuss how the capability to project intentions affect the task planning capabilities of a robot. Specifically, we will start with a discussion on how projection actions can be used to reveal information regarding the future intentions of the robot at the time of task execution. We will then pose a new planning paradigm - projection-aware planning - whereby a robot can trade off its plan cost with its ability to reveal its intentions using its projection actions. We will demonstrate each of these scenarios with the help of a joint human-robot activity using the HoloLens.

AB  - AI knowledge representation and reasoning methods consider actions to be blackboxes that abstract away from how they are executed. This abstract view does not suffice for the decision making capabilities required by robotic agents that are to accomplish manipulation tasks. Such robots have to reason about how to pour without spilling, where to grasp a pot, how to open different containers, and so on. To enable such reasoning it is necessary to consider how objects are perceived, how motions can be executed and parameterized, and how motion parameterization affects the physical effects of actions. To this end, we propose to complement and extend symbolic reasoning methods with KnowRobSIM, an additional reasoning infrastructure based on modern game engine technology, including the subsymbolic world modeling through data structures, action simulation based on physics engine, and world scene rendering. We demonstrate how KnowRobSIM can perform powerful reasoning, prediction, and learning tasks that are required for informed decision making in object manipulation.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a probabilistic collision threat assessment algorithm for autonomous driving at road intersections that assesses a given traffic situation at an intersection reliably and robustly for an autonomous vehicle to cross the intersection safely, even in the face of violation vehicles (that is, vehicles in violation of traffic rules at the intersection). To this end, the proposed algorithm employs a detailed digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then utilizes the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and potential collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, by means of Bayesian networks and time window filtering under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it assesses the potential threats regarding the possibility of collision reliably and robustly, even under uncertain and incomplete noise data. Then, it has been tested and evaluated through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of non-violation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is sufficiently reliable to be used in decision-making for autonomous driving at intersections in terms of reliability and robustness, even in the face of violation vehicles.

AB  - Reliable object perception is a vital requirement for automated driving. Despite the availability of precise contour measurements, most state-of-the-art tracking systems still represent object geometry as bounding boxes. However, there are objects operating in public traffic for which the box assumption is highly inappropriate. We therefore propose to represent object contours using 2D polylines. Taking into account the mutual dependence of object poses and shape, our tracking framework targets at a simultaneous estimation of both states. Moreover, we propose to augment scan segments with free-space information at their boundaries and show how this knowledge can be incorporated into the tracking framework and beyond. Evaluation with real scan data shows that our method produces accurate dynamic estimates and consistent shape reconstructions.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for fast and robust motion planning designed to facilitate automated driving. The framework allows for real-time computation even for horizons of several hundred meters and thus enabling automated driving in urban conditions. This is achieved through several features. Firstly, a convenient geometrical representation of both the search space and driving constraints enables the use of classical path planning approach. Thus, a wide variety of constraints can be tackled simultaneously (other vehicles, traffic lights, etc.). Secondly, an exact cost-to-go map, obtained by solving a relaxed problem, is then used by A*-based algorithm with model predictive flavour in order to compute the optimal motion trajectory. The algorithm takes into account both distance and time horizons. The approach is validated within a simulation study with realistic traffic scenarios. We demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to devise plans both in fast and slow driving conditions, even when full stop is required.

AB  - We present a location-specific method to visually track the positions of observed vehicles based on large-scale crowd-sourced maps. We equipped a large fleet of cars that drive around cities with camera phones mounted on the dashboard, and performed city-scale structure-from-motion to accurately reconstruct the trajectories taken by the vehicles. We show that these data can be used to first create a system enabling high-accuracy localisation, and then to accurately predict the future motion of newly observed cars in the camera view. As a basis for the method we use a recently proposed system [1] for unsupervised motion prediction and extend it to a real-time visual tracking pipeline which can track vehicles through noise and extended occlusions using only a monocular camera. The system is tested using two large-scale datasets of San Francisco and New York City containing millions of frames. We demonstrate the performance of the system in a variety of traffic, time, and weather conditions. The presented system requires no manual annotation or knowledge of road infrastructure. To our knowledge, this is the first time a perception system based on a large-scale crowd-sourced maps has been evaluated at this scale.

AB  - Recent developments in Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems have demonstrated the potential of road vehicles as an efficient mode of urban transportation Newly developed algorithms can compute vehicle routes in real-time for batches of requests and allow for multiple requests to share vehicles. These algorithms have primarily focused on optimally producing vehicle schedules to pick up and drop off requests. The redistribution of idle vehicles to areas of high demand, known as rebalancing, on the contrary has received little attention in the context of ride-sharing. In this paper, we present a method to rebalance idle vehicles in a ride-sharing enabled MoD fleet. This method consists of an algorithm to optimally partition the fleet operating area into rebalancing regions, an algorithm to determine a real-time demand estimate for every region using incoming requests, and an algorithm to optimize the assignment of idle vehicles to these rebalancing regions using an integer linear program. Evaluation with historical taxi data from Manhattan shows that we can service 99.8% of taxi requests in Manhattan using 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of 57.4 seconds and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds. Moreover, we can achieve a higher service rate using 2000 vehicles than prior work achieved with 3000. Furthermore, with a fleet of 3000 vehicles, we reduce the average travel delay by 86%, the average waiting time by 37%, and the amount of ignored requests by 95% compared to earlier work at the expense of an increased distance travelled by the fleet.

AB  - One desirable capability of autonomous cars is to accurately predict the pedestrian motion near intersections for safe and efficient trajectory planning. We are interested in developing transfer learning algorithms that can be trained on the pedestrian trajectories collected at one intersection and yet still provide accurate predictions of the trajectories at another, previously unseen intersection. We first discussed the feature selection for transferable pedestrian motion models in general. Following this discussion, we developed one transferable pedestrian motion prediction algorithm based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that infers pedestrian intentions and predicts future trajectories based on observed trajectory. We evaluated our algorithm at three intersections. We used the accuracy of augmented semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC), trained and tested at the same intersection as a baseline. The result shows that the proposed algorithm improves the baseline accuracy by a statistically significant percentage in both non-transfer task and transfer task.

AB  - A concept consisting of a new configurable vacuum gripper system and a corresponding method for determining optimal grasp configurations solely based on 3D vision is introduced. The robot system consists of a dynamically configurable vacuum gripper, a visual sensor, and a robot arm that are used in combination with a new grasp planner to robustly grasp unknown objects in arbitrary positions. For this purpose, formalized aspects of selecting contact surfaces for arbitrary suction cups are described; the concept involves visual detection of the objects, segmentation, iterative grasp planning, and action execution. The approach allows for a fast and efficient, yet precise execution of grasps. The core idea is a two-step 3D data acquisition approach and grasp point computation that takes advantage of the fact that the suction cups of the gripper can all be aligned axis-parallel. Therefore, an adequate sensor-based surface acquisition is done from a single viewpoint with respect to the gripper. Results of realworld experiments show that the proposed concept is suitable for a wide range of different and unknown objects in our setup.

AB  - Human hands can not only grasp objects of various shape and size and manipulate them in hands but also exert such a large gripping force that they can support the body in the situations such as dangling a bar and climbing a ladder. On the other hand, it is difficult for most robot hands to manage both. Therefore in this paper we developed the hand which can grasp various objects and exert large gripping force. To develop such hand, we focused on the thumb CM joint with wide range of motion and the MP joints of four fingers with the DOF of abduction and adduction. Based on the hand with large gripping force and flexibility using machined spring, we applied above mentioned joint mechanism to the hand. The thumb CM joint has wide range of motion because of the combination of three machined springs and MP joints of four fingers have variable rigidity mechanism instead of driving each joint independently in order to move joint in limited space and by limited actuators. Using the developed hand, we achieved the grasping of various objects, supporting a large load and several motions with an arm.

The 4 fingered VARO-fi consists of 9 degrees of freedom and it can perform several in-hand manipulation tasks which have been described in this paper. Moreover, the gripper is a simplification of previously proposed gripper platform called Dexclar. The derivation of VARO-fi has been presented and its capabilities have been demonstrated by experiments. Although a generic convex payload is considered as a primitive in the design of VARO-fi however, it is capable to address manipulation for other regular shaped payloads, which has been proven by experiments. A comparison is also illustrated in order to underline the strength of the novel gripper with respect to the state of the art.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a set of guidelines for the design of grippers suitable for a safe human robot/interaction in cooperative tasks. Modularity, adaptability, robustness, intuitive control, limited weight are some of the key elements that could allow to effectively spread these devices in industrial and service applications. Following such guidelines, we present the prototype of the Co-Gripper: a robotic device for cooperative manipulation tasks with humans. The gripper is composed of two pairs of fingers, actuated with two motors, that can be controlled in a coordinated way or independently. Each finger has a modular underactuated structure, composed of three phalanges connected by passive joints. The gripper is wireless, so it can be easily connected both to the robotic arms and on passive structures. We designed a wearable wireless control interface composed of a ring and a bracelet allowing a simple and intuitive activation of the gripper without limiting human operator's manipulation capabilities. We performed a set of tests to quantify gripper performance and to exploit its potentialities in human-robot cooperation tasks.

Novel concepts include the ability to interchange built-in tools without the need to grasp them, the ability to reposition grasped objects in-hand, the capability of performing classic dual arm manipulation within the gripper and the utilization of classic industrial robotic arms kinematics within a robotic gripper. We analyze state of the art grippers and robotic hands designed for dexterous in-hand manipulation and extract common characteristics and weak points. The presented concept is obtained from the task requirements for disassembly of electromechanical devices and it is then evaluated for general purpose grasping, in-hand manipulation and operations with tools. We further present the CAD design for a first prototype.

AB  - Millirobots are a promising robotic platform for many applications due to their small size and low manufacturing costs. Legged millirobots, in particular, can provide increased mobility in complex environments and improved scaling of obstacles. However, controlling these small, highly dynamic, and underactuated legged systems is difficult. Hand-engineered controllers can sometimes control these legged millirobots, but they have difficulties with dynamic maneuvers and complex terrains. We present an approach for controlling a real-world legged millirobot that is based on learned neural network models. Using less than 17 minutes of data, our method can learn a predictive model of the robot's dynamics that can enable effective gaits to be synthesized on the fly for following user-specified waypoints on a given terrain. Furthermore, by leveraging expressive, high-capacity neural network models, our approach allows for these predictions to be directly conditioned on camera images, endowing the robot with the ability to predict how different terrains might affect its dynamics. This enables sample-efficient and effective learning for locomotion of a dynamic legged millirobot on various terrains, including gravel, turf, carpet, and styrofoam.

AB  - Pushing is a common task in robotic scenarios. In real-world environments, robots need to manipulate various unknown objects without previous experience. We propose a data-driven approach for learning local inverse models of robot-object interaction for push manipulation. The robot makes observations of the object behaviour on the fly and adapts its movement direction. The proposed model is probabilistic, and we update it using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We test our method by pushing objects with a holonomic mobile robot base. Validation of results over a diverse object set demonstrates a high degree of robustness and a high success rate in pushing objects towards a fixed target and along a path compared to previous methods. Moreover, based on learned inverse models, the robot can learn object properties and distinguish between different object behaviours when they are pushed from different sides.

AB  - We present a reinforcement learning algorithm for learning sparse non-parametric controllers in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We improve the sample complexity of this approach by imposing a structure of the state-action function through a normalized advantage function (NAF). This representation of the policy enables efficiently composing multiple learned models without additional training samples or interaction with the environment. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm on learning obstacle-avoidance policies in multiple simulations of a robot equipped with a laser scanner while navigating in a 2D environment. We apply the composition operation to various policy combinations and test them to show that the composed policies retain the performance of their components. We also transfer the composed policy directly to a physical platform operating in an arena with obstacles in order to demonstrate a degree of generalization.

AB  - Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to developing hard-to-engineer adaptive solutions for complex and diverse robotic tasks. However, learning with real-world robots is often unreliable and difficult, which resulted in their low adoption in reinforcement learning research. This difficulty is worsened by the lack of guidelines for setting up learning tasks with robots. In this work, we develop a learning task with a UR5 robotic arm to bring to light some key elements of a task setup and study their contributions to the challenges with robots. We find that learning performance can be highly sensitive to the setup, and thus oversights and omissions in setup details can make effective learning, reproducibility, and fair comparison hard. Our study suggests some mitigating steps to help future experimenters avoid difficulties and pitfalls. We show that highly reliable and repeatable experiments can be performed in our setup, indicating the possibility of reinforcement learning research extensively based on real-world robots.

AB  - There have been several attempts at modeling context in robots. However, either these attempts assume a fixed number of contexts or use a rule-based approach to determine when to increment the number of contexts. In this paper, we pose the task of when to increment as a learning problem, which we solve using a Recurrent Neural Network. We show that the network successfully (with 98% testing accuracy) learns to predict when to increment, and demonstrate, in a scene modeling problem (where the correct number of contexts is not known), that the robot increments the number of contexts in an expected manner (i.e., the entropy of the system is reduced). We also present how the incremental model can be used for various scene reasoning tasks.

AB  - Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach to endowing robots with skills without having to program them by hand. Typically, LfD relies on human demonstrations in clutter-free environments. This prevents the demonstrations from being affected by irrelevant objects, whose influence can obfuscate the true intention of the human or the constraints of the desired skill. However, it is unrealistic to assume that the robot's environment can always be restructured to remove clutter when capturing human demonstrations. To contend with this problem, we develop an importance weighted batch and incremental skill learning approach, building on a recent inference-based technique for skill representation and reproduction. Our approach reduces unwanted environmental influences on the learned skill, while still capturing the salient human behavior. We provide both batch and incremental versions of our approach and validate our algorithms on a 7-DOF JACO2 manipulator with reaching and placing skills.

AB  - Establishing a symbiotic relationship between a human and a exoskeleton is the end goal in many applications in order to provide benefits to the user. However, the literature focusing on the human side of human-exoskeleton interaction has remained less exhaustive than the literature focusing on the design (hardware/software) of the exoskeleton device itself. It is, though, essential to understand how a human adapts his motor control when interacting with an exoskeleton. Motor adaptation is an implicit process carried out by the central nervous system when the body encounters a perturbation, a paradigm that has been extensively studied in the field of human motor control research. When wearing an exoskeleton, even “as-transparent-as-possible”, contact/interaction forces may impact well-known motor control laws in a way that may be detrimental to the user, and even compromise usability in real applications. The present paper investigates how interaction with a backdrivable upper-limb exoskeleton (ABLE) set in “transparent” mode of control affects the kinematics/dynamics of human movement in a simple task. We find that important motor control features are preserved when moving with ABLE but an overall movement slowness occurs, likely as a response to increased inertia according to optimal control simulations. Such a human motor control approach illustrates one possible way to assess the degree of symbiosis between human and exoskeleton, i.e. by grounding on well-known findings in motor control research.

AB  - This study reports the initial testing of a gait exoskeleton for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients having variable muscle strength with no balance or ambulation capabilities. To improve the quality of life of such patients, a pediatric gait exoskeleton was developed. The ATLAS exoskeleton has 8 active degrees of freedom (DOF): 2 at the hip (adduction/abduction and flexion/extension), 1 at the knee and ankle joint for flexion and extension. A feasibility test was performed to gauge the initial response of the patients. This study demonstrates that the exoskeleton was able to provide gait assistance and sit-to-stand movements effectively to the subjects. This kind of wearable exoskeleton will play a key role in the rehabilitation of SMA patients and delay further metabolic degeneration in the future.

AB  - Walking ability is critically important for pediatric health, well-being, and independence. Children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent cause of pediatric physical disability, often present pathological gait patterns that negatively impact walking capacity. Reduced function of the muscles surrounding the ankle joint in those with CP also greatly increases the energy cost of transport leading to reduce mobility. Ankle-foot-orthoses show limited effectiveness for clinically relevant improvement in gait mechanics, while orthopedic surgery, muscle injections and physical therapy are unable to completely restore gait function. While wearable exoskeletons hold promise for gait rehabilitation, appropriately controlling the timing and magnitude of powered assistance across individuals and conditions remains a considerable challenge. This work seeks to address this challenge through the design and initial clinical verification of a simple ankle exoskeleton control scheme designed to reduce the metabolic cost of transport during walking in an individual with CP. Preliminary experimental results from instrumented gait analysis following 5 training visits demonstrated a 45% increase in positive ankle power and a 16% reduction in net metabolic rate during walking with the exoskeleton providing powered plantar-flexion assistance compared to walking without the exoskeleton. Future work will expand this investigation to a larger cohort of individuals with CP and across additional modes of locomotion.

AB  - Multiplayer environments are thought to increase and prolongate active participation in robot-aided rehabilitation. We expect that environments linking patients with their spouses will particularly foster active participation. Thus, we developed two multiplayer games to link the game experience of two players: an Air Hockey game and a Haptic Kitchen game. In the competitive Air Hockey game, differences in skill levels between players were balanced by individualizing haptic guidance or damping forces. In the Haptic Kitchen game, a healthy player could support the patient's movements using a virtual force field. The two players could control the haptic interaction since both the force field and the point of application were visualized. We tested the haptic performance balancing algorithm of the Air Hockey game and the spouse-controlled haptic support of the Kitchen game with patients post-stroke who trained both single- (i.e., alone) and multiplayer training (i.e., with spouse) in eight therapy sessions lasting 45 min each. Mean total rating in Intrinsic Motivation Inventory was 46.9 points (out of 63 points) for multiplayer modes, and 42.7 points for single player modes, respectively. The spouses applied the haptic support in the Haptic Kitchen game during 42 % of the total game duration. We are currently testing more patient-spouse couples to better understand the effects of using these haptic approaches on the behavior and recovery of patients. We foresee this approach can improve the motivation during training and positively influence the at-home behavior of patients, an important goal of rehabilitation training efforts.

AB  - Wearable robotics offers a unique opportunity to explore how biological systems interface with engineered parts. But, due to a gap in understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms at work, the state of the art in design and development is a sophisticated form of automated trial and error. Progress is hampered by the difficulty of assessing the direct impact of wearable robots on underlying muscles, tendons and bones during human experimentation. While animal models have provided an experimental platform to explore other biological mechanisms, as of yet, no animal model of a wearable robot during locomotion has been developed. To fill this gap, we have built the first ever wearable robotic device for a freely-Iocomoting, non-human, bipedal animal (Numida melaegris = Guinea fowl), a species whose gait closely mirrors human locomotion mechanics. We found that a spring-loaded soft-exosuit that passively augments the energy stored in distal tendons was both well tolerated and provided consistent torques. Preliminary data showed birds systematically change their kinematics in response to changes to exo-suit spring stiffness, adjusting the timing but not magnitude of the assistive torques. This animal model for wearable robotics allows experiments up and down the broader spatiotemporal scale that are not currently possible in humans. With it we can address questions from short-term adaptations in musculoskeletal dynamics within a single step to broader behavioral and physical changes that come with long term use.

AB  - Aerial filming in action scenes using a drone is difficult for inexperienced flyers because manipulating a remote controller and meeting the desired image composition are two independent, while concurrent, tasks. Existing systems attempt to utilize wearable GPS-based or infrared-based sensors to track the human movement and to assist in capturing footage. However, these sensors work only in either indoor (infrared-based) or outdoor environments (GPS-based), but not both. In this paper, we introduce a novel drone filming system which integrates monocular 3D human pose estimation and localization into a drone platform to remove the constraints imposed by wearable-sensor-based solutions. Meanwhile, given the estimated position, we propose a novel drone control system, called “through-the-lens drone filming”, to allow a cameraman to conveniently control the drone by manipulating a 3D model in the preview, which closes the gap between the flight control and the viewpoint design. Our system includes two key enabling techniques: 1) subject localization based on visual-inertial fusion, and 2) through-the-lens camera planning. This is the first drone camera system which allows users to capture human actions by manipulating the camera in a virtual environment. From the drone hardware, we integrate a gimbal camera and two GPUs into the limited space of a drone and demonstrate the feasibility of running the entire system onboard with insignificant delays, which are sufficient for filming in our real-time application. Experimental results, in both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our techniques can greatly ease camera control and capture better videos.

AB  - Sensor payloads suspended from parachutes are often used in atmospheric profiling applications. They drift freely and often end up landing in inaccessible regions that make their retrieval challenging or impossible. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an approach using a multirotor unmanned aerial system to autonomously retrieve the parachute while it is still in the air. The system relies only on the initial conditions of the parachute-payload system and feedback from the vehicle's onboard cameras to track and then intercept the parachute mid-air in under 40 seconds on average. We present the results from our field experiments where we demonstrate the feasibility of the system and discuss its applicability to long-term payload transportation systems.

AB  - We have proposed airborne docking using two multi-rotor aerial robots. This paper presents a transport multi-rotor UAV with winch mechanism and a small multi-rotor with onboard locolization and mobile manipulation system. The winch mechanism enables the UAV to lower and raise a bar to transport another UAV attached to it. The airborne docking method used in our work is chosen in order to avoid the effect of downwash generated by the multi-rotors. With experiments we have verified the possibility of airborne docking, and evaluated how it influences the transport multi-rotor UAV as the load is changed, using the IMU data of UAV.

AB  - In this paper, we present a framework to do optimal time allocation for quadrotor trajectory generation. Using this method, we can generate minimum-time piecewise polynomial trajectories for quadrotor flights. We decouple the quadrotor trajectory generation problem into two folds. Firstly we generate a smooth and safe curve which is parameterized by a virtual variable. This curve named spatial trajectory is independent of time and has fixed spatial properties. Then a mapping function which decides how the quadrotor moves along the spatial trajectory respecting kinodynamic limits is found by minimizing total trajectory time. The mapping function maps the virtual variable to time is named temporal trajectory. We formulate the minimum-time temporal trajectory generation problem as a convex program which can be efficiently solved. We show that the proposed method can corporate with various types of previous trajectory generation method to obtain the optimal time allocation. The proposed method is integrated into a customized light-weight quadrotor platform and is validated by presenting autonomous flights in indoor and outdoor environments. We release our code for time optimization as an open-source ros-package.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of choosing measurement locations of an aerial robot in an online manner in order to localize an animal with a radio collar. The aerial robot has a commercial, low-cost directional antenna and USB receiver to capture the signal. It uses its own movement to obtain a bearing measurement. The uncertainty in these measurements is assumed to be bounded and represented as wedges. The measurements are then merged by intersecting the wedges. The localization uncertainty is quantified by the area of the resulting intersection. The goal is to reduce the localization uncertainty to a value below a given threshold in minimum time. We present an online strategy to choose measurement locations during execution based on previous readings and analyze its performance with competitive analysis. The time required to localize a target is upper-bounded by the function of measurement noise, desired localization uncertainty and minimum step length. We also validate the strategy in extensive simulations and show its applicability through field experiments over a 5 hectare area using an autonomous aerial robot equipped with a directional antenna.

Simulation results show ability to plan observation trajectories for a small fleet of UAVs, and to update the plans when new information on the fire are incorporated in the fire model.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce the achievement of the flight motion to pass through small opening by the multilinked and transformable aerial robot. Previous works about such motion are based on under-actuated multirotors, indicating that aggressive maneuvering is necessary condition. This involves two crucial problems: i) enough free space for deceleration is necessary, otherwise the robot would collide with unknown obstacle after exiting opening; ii) the multirotor can not traverse the openings that are smaller than the robot body. The proposed transformable aerial robot in our work can solve these problems, since the multilinked model can not only guarantee the near-hover condition during the whole motion sequence, but also slowly traverse relative small openings by changing its form like a snake. We first propose an improved dynamics derivation and flight control method for this multilinked aerial robot based on our previous work. Then, we present the path planning method which takes the flight stability in the near-hover condition into account. Finally we demonstrate the experimental results of the motion to pass through a horizontal and small opening which also involves the borders (the floor and the ceiling).

AB  - In this paper, we present a trajectory generation method for quadrotors based on the optimal smoothing B-spline. Compared to existing methods which rely on polynomial splines or time optimal control techniques, our method systematically addresses the issue of axes-coupled and interval-wise constraints. These constraints can be used to construct safe flying zones and satisfy vehicle's physical limits. The proposed approach has also been extended to generate trajectories from the nominal plan which consists of not only points but also lines and planes, opening a door for new improvements and applications. Moreover, a closed-form solution can be obtained for cases without inequality constraints. Such a solution is numerically stable for the large-scale fitting problem, which allows us to directly fit the human sketching input from the touch device and capture all subtle details. Our approach is verified by various real flight experiments..

AB  - This paper introduces the problem of long-range monocular depth estimation for outdoor urban environments. Range sensors and traditional depth estimation algorithms (both stereo and single view) predict depth for distances of less than 100 meters in outdoor settings and 10 meters in indoor settings. The shortcomings of outdoor single view methods that use learning approaches are, to some extent, due to the lack of long-range ground truth training data, which in turn is due to limitations of range sensors. To circumvent this, we first propose a novel strategy for generating synthetic long-range ground truth depth data. We utilize Google Earth images to reconstruct large-scale 3D models of different cities with proper scale. The acquired repository of 3D models and associated RGB views along with their long-range depth renderings are used as training data for depth prediction. We then train two deep neural network models for long-range depth estimation: i) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ii) a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We found in our experiments that the GAN model predicts depth more accurately. We plan to open-source the database and the baseline models for public use.

AB  - We propose a lightweight and ground-optimized lidar odometry and mapping method, LeGO-LOAM, for realtime six degree-of-freedom pose estimation with ground vehicles. LeGO-LOAM is lightweight, as it can achieve realtime pose estimation on a low-power embedded system. LeGO-LOAM is ground-optimized, as it leverages the presence of a ground plane in its segmentation and optimization steps. We first apply point cloud segmentation to filter out noise, and feature extraction to obtain distinctive planar and edge features. A two-step Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method then uses the planar and edge features to solve different components of the six degree-of-freedom transformation across consecutive scans. We compare the performance of LeGO-LOAM with a state-of-the-art method, LOAM, using datasets gathered from variable-terrain environments with ground vehicles, and show that LeGO-LOAM achieves similar or better accuracy with reduced computational expense. We also integrate LeGO-LOAM into a SLAM framework to eliminate the pose estimation error caused by drift, which is tested using the KITTI dataset.

AB  - Man-made environments such as households, offices, or factory floors are typically composed of linear structures. Accordingly, polylines are a natural way to accurately represent their geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic method to extract polylines from raw 2-D laser range scans. The key idea of our approach is to determine a set of polylines that maximizes the likelihood of a given scan. In extensive experiments carried out on publicly available real-world datasets and on simulated laser scans, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, while showing comparable computational requirements. Our implementation is available under https://github.com/acschaefer/ple.

AB  - Robust data association is necessary for virtually every SLAM system and finding corresponding points is typically a preprocessing step for scan alignment algorithms. Traditionally, handcrafted feature descriptors were used for these problems but recently learned descriptors have been shown to perform more robustly. In this work, we propose a local feature descriptor for 3D LiDAR scans. The descriptor is learned using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our proposed architecture consists of a Siamese network for learning a feature descriptor and a metric learning network for matching the descriptors. We also present a method for estimating local surface patches and obtaining ground-truth correspondences. In extensive experiments, we compare our learned feature descriptor with existing 3D local descriptors and report highly competitive results for multiple experiments in terms of matching accuracy and computation time.

AB  - Many mobile robots rely on 2D laser scanners for localization, mapping, and navigation. However, those sensors are unable to correctly provide distance to obstacles such as glass panels and tables whose actual occupancy is invisible at the height the sensor is measuring. In this work, instead of estimating the distance to obstacles from richer sensor readings such as 3D lasers or RGBD sensors, we present a method to estimate the distance directly from raw 2D laser data. To learn a mapping from raw 2D laser distances to obstacle distances we frame the problem as a learning task and train a neural network formed as an autoencoder. A novel configuration of network hyperparameters is proposed for the task at hand and is quantitatively validated on a test set. Finally, we qualitatively demonstrate in real time on a Care-O-bot 4 that the trained network can successfully infer obstacle distances from partial 2D laser readings.

AB  - Multi-beam lidar (MBL) scanners are compact, light, and accessible 3D sensors with high data rates, but they offer limited vertical resolution and field of view (FOV). Some recent robotics research has profited from the addition of a degree-of-freedom (DOF) to an MBL to build rotating multibeam lidars (RMBL) that can achieve high-resolution scans with full spherical FOV. In a previous work, we offered a methodology to analyze the complex 3D scan measurement distributions produced by RMBLs with a rolling DOF and no pitching. In this paper, we investigate the effect of introducing constant pitch angles in the construction of the RMBLs with the purpose of finding a kinematic configuration that optimizes scan homogeneity with a spherical FOV. To this end, we propose a scalar index of 3D sensor homogeneity that is based on the spherical formulation of Ripley's K function. The optimization is performed for the widely used Puck (VLP-16) and HDL-32 sensors by Velodyne.

AB  - Long-term visual localization in outdoor environment is a challenging problem, especially faced with the cross-seasonal, bi-directional tasks and changing environment. In this paper we propose a novel visual inertial localization framework that localizes against the LiDAR-built map. Based on the geometry information of the laser map, a hybrid bundle adjustment framework is proposed, which estimates the poses of the cameras with respect to the prior laser map as well as optimizes the state variables of the online visual inertial odometry system simultaneously. For more accurate crossmodal data association, the laser map is optimized using multisession laser and visual data to extract the salient and stable subset for visual localization. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, we collect data in south part of our campus in different seasons, along the same and opposite-direction route. In all sessions of localization data, our proposed method gives satisfactory results, and shows the superiority of the hybrid bundle adjustment and map optimization1.

AB  - Compared to diverse feature detectors and descriptors used for visual scenes, describing a place using structural information is relatively less reported. Recent advances in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) provides dense 3D maps of the environment and the localization is proposed by diverse sensors. Toward the global localization based on the structural information, we propose Scan Context, a non-histogram-based global descriptor from 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scans. Unlike previously reported methods, the proposed approach directly records a 3D structure of a visible space from a sensor and does not rely on a histogram or on prior training. In addition, this approach proposes the use of a similarity score to calculate the distance between two scan contexts and also a two-phase search algorithm to efficiently detect a loop. Scan context and its search algorithm make loop-detection invariant to LiDAR viewpoint changes so that loops can be detected in places such as reverse revisit and corner. Scan context performance has been evaluated via various benchmark datasets of 3D LiDAR scans, and the proposed method shows a sufficiently improved performance.

AB  - We consider a multi-robot variant of the mission monitoring problem. This problem arises in tasks where a robot observes the progress of another robot that is stochastically following a known trajectory, among other applications. We formulate and solve a variant where multiple tracker robots must monitor a single target robot, which is important because it enables the use of multi-robot systems to improve task performance in practice, such as in marine robotics missions. Our algorithm coordinates the behaviour of the trackers by computing optimal single-robot paths given a probabilistic representation of the other robots' paths. We employ a decentralised scheme that optimises over probability distributions of plans and has useful analytical properties. The planned trajectories collectively maximise the probability of observing the target throughout the mission with respect to probabilistic motion and observation models. We report simulation results for up to 8 robots that support our analysis and indicate that our algorithm is a feasible solution for improving the performance of mission monitoring systems.

AB  - Leader-Follower is a hierarchical form of multi-robot formation control, where each robot aims to maintain specific predefined angle and distance from one or more robots in the team (referred to as its local leaders), while a single robot is selected to lead the entire formation to a desired destination. When the robots are given a specific formation to maintain, their goal is usually to minimize the deviation from this desired formation (maximizing the accuracy) during their journey. Previous work has considered optimality in an uncertain environment only in centralized setting (or using perfect, or almost perfect communication). In this paper we examine the problem of optimal multi-robot formation control in a distributed setting, while accounting for two challenges: sensory uncertainty and absence of communication. Specifically, we present an algorithm that allows each individual robot to estimate the overall formation accuracy of the other robots in their field of view via a tree reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm is used to select the most accurate local leader, or to generate virtual local leader via a weighted average of all visible robots. We provide both theoretical analysis and an extensive empirical evaluation (in ROS/Gazebo simulated environment) showing the effectiveness of the two approaches.
