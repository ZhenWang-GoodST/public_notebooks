AB  - Providing force feedback as a feature in current Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery systems still remains a challenge. In recent years, Vision-Based Force Sensing (VBFS) has emerged as a promising approach to address this problem. Existing methods have been developed in a Supervised Learning (SL) setting. Nonetheless, most of the video sequences related to robotic surgery are not provided with ground-truth force data, which can be easily acquired in a controlled environment. A powerful approach to process unlabeled video sequences and find a compact representation for each video frame relies on using an Unsupervised Learning (UL) method. Afterward, a model trained in an SL setting can take advantage of the available ground-truth force data. In the present work, UL and SL techniques are used to investigate a model in a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, consisting of an encoder network and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. First, a Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) is trained to learn a compact representation for each RGB frame in a video sequence. To facilitate the reconstruction of high and low frequencies found in images, this CAE is optimized using an adversarial framework and a L1-loss, respectively. Thereafter, the encoder network of the CAE is serially connected with an LSTM network and trained jointly to minimize the difference between ground-truth and estimated force data. Datasets addressing the force estimation task are scarce. Therefore, the experiments have been validated in a custom dataset. The results suggest that the proposed approach is promising.

AB  - Task autonomy is an important consideration for the development of future surgical robots. For robot-assisted anastomosis, suture thread detection is a prerequisite for subsequent robot manipulation. Previous works on automatic thread detection are focused on the learning of the models with specific surgical settings that are poorly generalisable to generic settings. In this paper, we propose a joint feature learning framework that caters for the foreground and background adaptation for surgical suture thread detection. The proposed method is developed in the context of semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation, leveraging the labelled training data from the source domain to learn the detection model for unlabelled or partially labelled target domain, which can also be from different types of threads or organs. Based on adversarial learning, we further preserve the semantic identity and introduce curriculum adaptation to generate synthetic data. Experiments on four domain adaptation tasks for suture thread detection demonstrate the strength of the proposed method being able to generate good quality synthetic data and transfer between specific domains with limited or even no labelled data of the target domain.

AB  - To improve the efficiency of surgical trajectory segmentation for robot learning in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, this paper presents a fast unsupervised method using video and kinematic data, followed by a promoting procedure to address the over-segmentation issue. Unsupervised deep learning network, stacking convolutional auto-encoder, is employed to extract more discriminative features from videos in an effective way. To further improve the accuracy of segmentation, on one hand, wavelet transform is used to filter out the noises existed in the features from video and kinematic data. On the other hand, the segmentation result is promoted by identifying the adjacent segments with no state transition based on the predefined similarity measurements. Extensive experiments on a public dataset JIGSAWS show that our method achieves much higher accuracy of segmentation than state-of-the-art methods in the shorter time.

AB  - Capsule endoscopes have gained popularity over the last decade as minimally invasive devices for diagnosing gastrointestinal abnormalities such as colorectal cancer. While this technology offers a less invasive and more convenient alternative to traditional scopes, these capsules are only able to provide observational capabilities due to their passive nature. With the addition of a reliable mobility system and a real-time navigation system, capsule endoscopes could transform from observational devices into active surgical tools, offering biopsy and therapeutic capabilities and even autonomous navigation in a single minimally invasive device. In this work, a vision system is developed to allow for autonomous lumen center tracking and haustral fold identification and tracking during colonoscopy. This system is tested for its ability to accurately identify and track multiple haustral folds across many frames in both simulated and in vivo video, and the lumen center tracking is tested onboard a robotic endoscope platform (REP) within an active simulator to demonstrate autonomous navigation. In addition, real-time localization is demonstrated using open source ORB-SLAM2. The vision system successfully identified 95.6% of Haustral folds in simulator frames and 70.6% in in vivo frames and false positives occurred in less than 1% of frames. The center tracking algorithm showed in vivo center estimates within a mean error of 6.6% of physician estimates and allowed for the REP to traverse 2 m of the active simulator in 6 minutes without intervention.

AB  - Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy is a recommended treatment method for large kidney stone removal. However, the first and most important step, i.e., getting the percutaneous access to create the tract between the targeted calyx and the flank skin, is challenging as the surgeon is often occupied by several tasks at a given time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a robotic assisted system that collaborates with the surgeon and provides assistance in order for the surgeons to focus on more critical jobs resulting in better surgical performance. A procedure for this robot including three working stages is described. This procedure allows the surgeon to choose a suitable percutaneous target using an ultrasound probe based on his or her experience and the robot will track the respiratory motion of the target kidney stone and insert the needle automatically after the surgeon releases the probe. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the procedure with the proposed assisted robot for PCNL.

AB  - Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has recently enabled humans with motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI) to independently stand and recover some lost autonomic function. However, the nature of the recovered motor activity and the interplay between SCS and motor training are not well understood. Understanding the effect of stand training and spinal stimulation on motor activity during bipedal standing is important for designing spinal rehabilitation therapies that seek to combine spinal stimulation and rehabilitative robots. In this study, we examined electromyography (EMG) data gathered from two SCI patients and six healthy subjects as they attempted standing. We analyzed the muscle activation patterns and EMG waveform shape to quantify both the changes in SCI patient motor activity with training, and the differences between healthy motor activity and SCI patient motor activity under stimulation. We also looked for correlations between the similarity in SCI patients' motor activity to healthy subjects and their overall standing ability. We found that good standing in SCI patients does not emulate healthy standing muscle activity. Furthermore, patient stand training heavily influenced motor activation patterns, but not in ways that improved standing ability. These results indicate that current training techniques do not optimally influence motor activity, and robotic rehabilitation strategies for SCI patients should target essential features of motor activity to optimize functional performance, rather than emulate healthy activity.

AB  - Force feedback during robotic surgery is critical in order to minimize potential injury to the patient and decrease recovery time from surgical procedures. Here we describe the use of a novel strain gauge printing method to apply low profile, low cost sensors directly to the surface of da Vinci surgical robot end effectors (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) to sense deflection and provide force feedback. This additive, vapor-deposition-based sensor fabrication method is used to deposit strain gauges directly onto the surfaces of the end effectors with minimal disruption to the device and without the need for adhesives or machining operations. Initial experiments characterize sensor performance and indicate the applicability of the proposed approach for force feedback during minimally invasive procedures.

General models and standard methods for emotion definition and recognition are briefly described, as well as strategies for computing the group global emotion, knowing the individual emotions of group members. This work is based on Ekman's extended “Big Six” emotional model, popular in Computer Science and Affective Computing. Emotion recognition via facial expression analysis is performed with a cloud-computing based solution, using Microsoft Azure Cognitive services. First, the performances of both the Face API to detect faces, and Emotion API, to compute emotion via face expression analysis, are tested. After that, a solution to compute the emotion of a group of people has been implemented and its performances compared to human perceptions. This work presents concepts and strategies which can be generalized for applications within the scope of assistive robotics and, more broadly, affective computing, wherever it will be necessary to determine the emotion of a group of people.

AB  - Humans and mobile robots will be increasingly cohabiting in the same environments, which has lead to an increase in studies on human robot interaction (HRI). One important topic in these studies is the development of robot navigation algorithms that are socially compliant to humans navigating in the same space. In this paper, we present a method to learn human navigation behaviors using maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning (MEDIRL). We use a large open dataset of pedestrian trajectories collected in an uncontrolled environment as the expert demonstrations. Human navigation behaviors are captured by a nonlinear reward function through deep neural network (DNN) approximation. The developed MEDIRL algorithm takes feature inputs including social affinity map (SAM) that are extracted from human motion trajectories. We perform simulation experiments using the learned reward function, and the performance is evaluated comparing it with the real measured pedestrian trajectories in the dataset. The evaluation results show that the proposed method has acceptable prediction accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and it can generate pedestrian trajectories similar to real human trajectories with natural social navigation behaviors such as collision avoidance, leader-follower, and split-and-rejoin.

AB  - Research in human teamwork shows that a key element of fluid and fluent interactions is the interpretation of implicit verbal and non-verbal cues in context. This poses an issue to robotic platforms, however, as they have historically worked best when controlled through explicit commands that have employed structured, unequivocal representations of the external world and their human partners. In this work, we present a framework for effectively grounding situated and naturalistic speech to action selection during human-robot collaborative activities. This is accomplished by maintaining and incrementally updating separate “speech” and “context” models that jointly classify a collaborator's utterance. We evaluate the efficacy of the system on a collaborative construction task with an autonomous robot and human participants. We first demonstrate that our system is capable of acquiring and deploying new task representations from limited and naturalistic data sets, and without any prior domain knowledge of language or the task itself. Finally, we show that our system is capable of significantly improving performance on an unfamiliar task after a one-shot exposure.

AB  - People engage in social coordination without explicitly communicating when they are conflicting over spatial resources, e.g., a shop clerk who yields to customers the best place to view products. In this study, we proposed a method that achieves such social coordination with a robot. Our idea is that the social coordination between two agents can be represented as utility-maximizing behavior for joint utility rather than just by a single agent utility. That is, given that each agent's reasonable behavior can be represented as utility-maximizing behavior for single agent utility, we model each agent's plans for himself as well as for the partner agent. Moreover, superiority relationships exist in this joint-utility computation. Since each agent knows such superiority relationships, social coordination can be modeled as utility-yielding behavior based on informed superiority. We specifically focus on looking-together situations for which we developed a utility model. With simulations, we investigate whether the above joint-utility-based modeling successfully reproduces social coordination in looking-together situations. We conducted an experiment in a situation where a tele-operated robot and a customer together look at products in a shop environment. Our experimental results show that our proposed method enables the robot to socially coordinate spatial resources, yielding significantly more thoughtful, less-self-centered, and appropriate impressions than the alternate robot.

AB  - Robots deployed for long periods of time need to be able to explore and learn from their environment. One approach to this problem has been reinforcement learning (RL), in which robots receive rewards from the environment that allow them to choose optimal actions. To speed learning when human supervision is available, interactive reinforcement learning solicits feedback from a human teacher. However, this approach typically assumes that learning takes place under continuous supervision, which is unlikely to hold in long-term scenarios. We propose an extension to a method of interactive reinforcement learning, policy shaping, that takes into account human attention. Our approach enables better performance while unattended by favoring information-gathering actions when attended and actions that have received positive feedback when unattended. We test our approach in both simulation and on a robot, finding that our method learns faster than policy shaping and performs more safely than policy shaping while no one is paying attention to the robot.

AB  - For generating interactive behavior of robot to build a long-term relationship between humans and robots, we focus on the difference in familiarity of the human behaviors during conversation. It is difficult to extract interaction motion features correlated to such familiarity as a model in manual. Therefore, we use a machine learning technique: convolution neural network to learn and generate interaction behavior with different familiarity. In the evaluation experiment, we generated interaction behavior using a convolution neural network, which learned from the behaviors of friendship and unknown relationship, who have high and low familiarity respectively. We evaluated how much such interaction behavior affect the human impression by questionnaire survey.

AB  - Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important aspect of effective human-robot collaboration and received a lot of attention from the research community. For example, many neural network-based architectures were proposed recently and pushed the performance to a new level. However, the applicability of such neural SER models trained only on in-domain data to noisy conditions is currently under-researched. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art neural acoustic emotion recognition models in human-robot interaction scenarios. We hypothesize that a robot's ego noise, room conditions, and various acoustic events that can occur in a home environment can significantly affect the performance of a model. We conduct several experiments on the iCub robot platform and propose several novel ways to reduce the gap between the model's performance during training and testing in real-world conditions. Furthermore, we observe large improvements in the model performance on the robot and demonstrate the necessity of introducing several data augmentation techniques like overlaying background noise and loudness variations to improve the robustness of the neural approaches.

AB  - When a human supervisor collaborates with a team of robots, the human's attention is divided, and cognitive resources are at a premium. We aim to optimize the distribution of these resources and the flow of attention. To this end, we propose the model of an idealized supervisor to describe human behavior. Such a supervisor employs a potentially inaccurate internal model of the the robots' dynamics to judge safety. We represent these safety judgements by constructing a safe set from this internal model using reachability theory. When a robot leaves this safe set, the idealized supervisor will intervene to assist, regardless of whether or not the robot remains objectively safe. False positives, where a human supervisor incorrectly judges a robot to be in danger, needlessly consume supervisor attention. In this work, we propose a method that decreases false positives by learning the supervisor's safe set and using that information to govern robot behavior. We prove that robots behaving according to our approach will reduce the occurrence of false positives for our idealized supervisor model. Furthermore, we empirically validate our approach with a user study that demonstrates a significant (p = 0.0328) reduction in false positives for our method compared to a baseline safety controller.

AB  - In autonomous driving systems a strong relation to highly accurate maps is taken to be inevitable, although street scenes change frequently. However, a preferable system would be to equip the automated cars with a sensor system that is able to navigate urban scenarios without an accurate map. We present a novel pipeline using a deep neural network to detect lane semantics and topology given RGB images. On the basis of this classification, the information about the road scene can be extracted just from the sensor setup supporting mapless autonomous driving. In addition to superseding the huge effort of creating and maintaining highly accurate maps, our system reduces the need for precise localization. Using an extended Cityscapes dataset, we show accurate ego lane detection including lane semantics on challenging scenarios for autonomous driving.

AB  - Increasing the accessibility of autonomous robots also for inexperienced users requires user-friendly and high-level control opportunities of robotic systems. While automated planning is able to decompose a complex task into a sequence of steps which reaches an intended goal, it is difficult to formulate such a goal without knowing the internals of the planning system and the exact capabilities of the robot. This becomes even more important in dynamic environments in which manipulable objects are subject to change. In this paper, we present an adaptive control interface which allows users to specify goals based on an internal world model by incrementally building referring expressions to the objects in the world. We consider fetch-and-carry tasks and automatically deduce potential high-level goals from the world model to make them available to the user. Based on its perceptions our system can react to changes in the environment by adapting the goal formulation within the domain-independent planning system.

AB  - Given the description of an object, s physical attributes, humans can determine a proper strategy and grasp an object. This paper proposes an approach to determine grasping strategy for an anthropomorphic robotic hand simply based on natural-language descriptions of an object. A learning-based approach is proposed to help a robotic hand learn suitable grasp poses starting from the natural language description of the object. Object features are parsed from natural-language descriptions by using a customized natural-language processing technique. The most likely grasp type for the given object is learned from the human grasping taxonomy based on the parsed features. The grasping strategy generated by the proposed approach is evaluated both by simulation study and execution of the grasps on an AR10 robotic hand.

AB  - In an autonomous vehicle setting, we propose a method for the estimation of a semantic grid, i.e. a bird's eye grid centered on the car's position and aligned with its driving direction, which contains high-level semantic information about the environment and its actors. Each grid cell contains a semantic label with divers classes, as for instance {Road, Vegetation, Building, Pedestrian, Car...}. We propose a hybrid approach, which combines the advantages of two different methodologies: we use Deep Learning to perform semantic segmentation on monocular RGB images with supervised learning from labeled groundtruth data. We combine these segmentations with occupancy grids calculated from LIDAR data using a generative Bayesian particle filter. The fusion itself is carried out with a deep neural network, which learns to integrate geometric information from the LIDAR with semantic information from the RGB data. We tested our method on two datasets, namely the KITTI dataset, which is publicly available and widely used, and our own dataset obtained with our own platform, equipped with a LIDAR and various sensors. We largely outperform baselines which calculate the semantic grid either from the RGB image alone or from LIDAR output alone, showing the interest of this hybrid approach.

AB  - Many robotics applications involve navigating to positions specified in terms of their semantic significance. A robot operating in a hotel may need to deliver room service to a named room. In a hospital, it may need to deliver medication to a patient's room. The Building-Wide Intelligence Project at UT Austin has been developing a fleet of autonomous mobile robots, called BWIBots, which perform tasks in the computer science department. Tasks include guiding a person, delivering a message, or bringing an object to a location such as an office, lecture hall, or classroom. The process of constructing a map that a robot can use for navigation has been simplified by modern SLAM algorithms. The attachment of semantics to map data, however, remains a tedious manual process of labeling locations in otherwise automatically generated maps. This paper introduces a system called PRISM to automate a step in this process by enabling a robot to localize door signs - a semantic markup intended to aid the human occupants of a building - and to annotate these locations in its map.

AB  - For the success of visually-guided robotic errand service, it is critical to ensure dependability under various ill-conditioned visual environments. To this end, we have developed Adaptive Bayesian Recognition Framework in which in-situ selection of multiple sets of optimal features or evidences as well as proactive collection of sufficient evidences are proposed to implement the principle of dependability. The framework has shown excellent performance with a limited number of objects in a scene. However, there arises a need to extend the framework for handling a larger number of objects without performance degradation, while avoiding difficulty in feature engineering. To this end, a novel deep learning architecture, referred to here as FER-CNN, is introduced and integrated into the Adaptive Bayesian Recognition Framework. FER-CNN has capability of not only extracting but also reconstructing a hierarchy of features with the layer-wise independent feedback connections that can be trained. Reconstructed features representing parts of 3D objects then allow them to be semantically linked to ontology for exploring object categories and properties. Experiments are conducted in a home environment with real 3D daily-life objects as well as with the standard ModelNet dataset. In particular, it is shown that FER-CNN allows the number of objects and their categories to be extended by 10 and 5 times, respectively, while registering the recognition rate for ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 by 97% and 89.5%, respectively.

AB  - We present a filtering-based method for semantic mapping to simultaneously detect objects and localize their 6 degree-of-freedom pose. For our method, called Contextual Temporal Mapping (or CT-Map), we represent the semantic map as a belief over object classes and poses across an observed scene. Inference for the semantic mapping problem is then modeled in the form of a Conditional Random Field (CRF). CT-Map is a CRF that considers two forms of relationship potentials to account for contextual relations between objects and temporal consistency of object poses, as well as a measurement potential on observations. A particle filtering algorithm is then proposed to perform inference in the CT-Map model. We demonstrate the efficacy of the CT-Map method with a Michigan Progress Fetch robot equipped with a RGB-D sensor. Our results demonstrate that the particle filtering based inference of CT-Map provides improved object detection and pose estimation with respect to baseline methods that treat observations as independent samples of a scene.

AB  - This paper develops new methods to design high performance rotary series elastic actuator springs for robotics applications. The approach is based on a spring arm mathematical model that was previously introduced by the authors. The key contribution is the development of an optimization-based design method which maximizes the springs' overall torque density through optimization of the arm profile. An improved analysis algorithm allows for rapid torsional loading response simulation with possible internal contacts between the spring arms. The proposed design and analysis algorithms are validated through FEA and prototype mechanical testing.

AB  - This paper presents a dexterous three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) wrist mechanism with a large range of motion and uniform manipulability without singular points throughout the entire range of motion. It has a 2-DOF spherical pure rolling joint surrounded by two pairs of actuating wires, the motions of which directly represent the quaternion values of the joint; this joint is therefore named the quaternion joint. Based on this property, it has simple and clear forward and inverse kinematics and high manipulability. By adding a 1-DOF rotation joint at the distal end of the quaternion joint, it can be extended to a 3-DOF joint mechanism. To precisely approximate the spherical pure rolling motion in a confined central space, a novel parallel mechanism composed of three identical supporting linkages was introduced. Unlike conventional parallel mechanisms, it has a compact and simple structure with no interference among the supporting linkages. Because the wrist mechanism is a tendon-driven mechanism, and is thus suitable for lightweight manipulators, it is mounted to a low-inertia manipulator with high stiffness and strength, namely, LIMS2-AMBIDEX, which is an improved version of the authors' previous research. The basic concept and thorough theoretical analysis of the wrist mechanism are described herein, and the simulations and experiments conducted for a quantitative validation are presented.

AB  - A 2 motor 2 degrees-of-freedom (2M2D) coupled tendon driven joint module is proposed as a basic component for robot arms. Torque reallocation via tendon coupling can enhance the output torque of one single joint. According to the motor position, the joint module is classified into four types: the externally-actuated structure, the internally-coaxially-actuated structure, the internally-separately-actuated structure, and the hybrid-actuated structure. The four structures are analyzed and compared, and their implementation design examples are given. Experiments comparing the proposed joint module with directly-actuated traditional joint suggested that the 2M2D coupled tendon-driven joint module can obtain high control accuracy, and the torque reallocation via tendon coupling is effective to improve output torque. Additionally, an anthropomorphic robot arm with low weight and high payload was developed to show the utility of the proposed joint module.

AB  - This study presents a differential elastic joint for use in multi-linked pipeline inspection robots. Active joints to stretch against the pipe wall are essential for adapting robots to use in vertical pipes and slippery inner surfaces where a large traction force is required. Series elastic actuators with a high reduction system have typically been used to sense force/torque in such applications. However, compactness, power, and bi-directional series elasticity are required to conduct in-pipe inspections. In this study, we propose an active joint using a differential elastic actuator with a rubber spring for decreasing the size and increasing the stiffness of the joint. After describing the configuration of the differential elastic actuator that is suitable for our robot and the design theory of the rubber spring cross-section, we conducted experiments to verify its torque property.

AB  - In this study, we propose an extended coaxial spherical joint module (E-CoSMo) with three to four degrees of freedom (DOFs) for a multi-DOF robot platform. The E-CoSMo consists of a coaxial spherical parallel mechanism (CSPM) with three DOFs and one extended DOF based on a universal joint mechanism (UJM) coaxially connected to the CSPM. This structure enables the application of serial link configuration (such as shoulder-elbow) with wide and universal ROMs while allowing all four actuators to be placed in the base. This makes the inertia of the moving link part to be dramatically reduced and thus contributes to decreasing the mechanical impedance of the multi-DOF robot system. In addition, through the effective design of the coaxial spherical joint module, the output rotational torque in a specific axial direction reaches approximately three times then the torque of a single actuator. To optimally implement this, we applied an optimal design approach that considers the mechanical performance and design constraints. The mechanical impedance reduction effect through the proposed module is discussed. The feasibility of the E-CoSMo is also verified through a dynamic simulation. Finally, the proposed mechanism is verified using a fabricated prototype.

AB  - Many surgical robots are remotely actuated by means of wire cables. In the past, the cables wound around circular pulleys at the robot joints did not constitute a problem of the cable driver structure. However, the pulleys inside the joints are removed recently in order to miniaturize the joints, so a specially designed cable driver suitable for the miniature joint structure is required for stable driving. In this paper, we propose a novel cable driver design for driving a pulleyless rolling joint and extend it to 2-DOF structure. Then, the proposed cable driver is manufactured using 3D printing with the 2-DOF bending joint, and an experiment is performed to evaluate them using the prototype. The cable driver proposed in this paper can drive pulleyless rolling joints stably with low cable tension. In addition, it can decouple yaw and pitch motion of the joints completely, therefore it can be applied to a variety of thin robots and instruments including steerable endoscopes and surgical robots.

AB  - Robotic systems for object handling and manipulation are hugely important for modern engineering and industry, with their efficiency, agility and robustness often depending on gripper design and performance. In this work, we investigate a gripper design that, when driven by a twisted string actuator, exhibits nearly-constant transmission ratio throughout its motion range. This allows for design of a highly-compact, modular and efficient robotic gripper driven by a low-power motor. We investigate kinematics of the device, experimentally verify developed models with a practical gripper testbed, and analyze transmission ratio and efficiency of the designed device. The resulting system has a nearly-constant transmission ratio of 550, with the constancy coefficient of 0.985.

AB  - In this paper, we present a multi-link articulated wheeled in-pipe robot that can drive the wheel and roll joint by using only a single actuator installed in each link. The proposed mechanism enables the robot to move forward or backward and helically in pipes owing to rotation of the drive wheel and twisting of the body. These two movements are generated by a miter-geared differential mechanism installed in each joint, and the magnitudes of these movements depend on the load applied to the wheels and roll joints. However, controlling of two outputs independently and aligning the rotation of the roll joints as desired are extremely challenging. Therefore, in this study, we switch those two movements by driving the rear wheels and the front wheels of the robot alternately. In addition, a stopper is used to constrain the roll joint movement. By calculating the angle of elevation of the robot's helical movement in the pipe by using a kinematic model, we can design a stopper to precisely adjust the roll angle. We verified that the robot can twist using the differential mechanism, and we validated experimentally the effectiveness of the stopper.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) controller for multirotor aerial robots based on a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm named Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). The proposed RL-IBVS controller is successfully trained in a Gazebo-based simulation scenario in order to learn the appropriate IBVS policy for directly mapping a state, based on errors in the image, to the linear velocity commands of the aerial robot. A thorough validation of the proposed controller has been conducted in simulated and real flight scenarios, demonstrating outstanding capabilities in object following applications. Moreover, we conduct a detailed comparison of the RL-IBVS controller with respect to classic and partitioned IBVS approaches.

AB  - This paper presents a visual odometry approach using a Pixel Processor Array (PPA) camera, specifically, the SCAMP-5 vision chip. In this device, each pixel is capable of storing data and performing computation, enabling a variety of computer vision tasks to be carried out directly upon the sensor itself. In this work the PPA performs HDR edge detection, perspective correction and image alignment based odometry, allowing the position and heading of a MAV to be tracked at several hundred frames per second. We evaluate our PPA based approach by direct comparison with a motion capture system for a variety of trajectories. These include rapid accelerations that would incur significant motion blur at low frame rates, and lighting conditions that would typically lead to under or over exposure of image detail. Such challenging conditions would often lead to unusable images when relying on traditional image sensors.

AB  - In many applications, maintaining a consistent dense map of the environment is key to enabling robotic platforms to perform higher level decision making. Several works have addressed the challenge of creating precise dense 3D maps from visual sensors providing depth information. However, during operation over longer missions, reconstructions can easily become inconsistent due to accumulated camera tracking error and delayed loop closure. Without explicitly addressing the problem of map consistency, recovery from such distortions tends to be difficult. We present a novel system for dense 3D mapping which addresses the challenge of building consistent maps while dealing with scalability. Central to our approach is the representation of the environment as a collection of overlapping Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) subvolumes. These subvolumes are localized through feature-based camera tracking and bundle adjustment. Our main contribution is a pipeline for identifying stable regions in the map, and to fuse the contributing subvolumes. This approach allows us to reduce map growth while still maintaining consistency. We demonstrate the proposed system on a publicly available dataset and simulation engine, and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for building consistent and scalable maps. Finally we demonstrate our approach running in real-time onboard a lightweight Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV).

The main reason for the term “indoor” came from the fact that in outdoor environments, drones could rely on global navigation systems such as GPS for their position and velocity estimates. By focusing on unknown indoor environments, the research had to focus on solutions using onboard sensors and processing. In this article, we present an overview of the state of the art and remaining challenges in this area, with a focus on small drones.

AB  - Deep learning techniques for motion control have recently been qualitatively improved, since the successful application of Deep Q- Learning to the continuous action domain in Atari-like games. Based on these ideas, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm was able to provide impressive results in continuous state and action domains, which are closely linked to most of the robotics-related tasks. In this paper, a vision-based autonomous multirotor landing maneuver on top of a moving platform is presented. The behaviour has been completely learned in simulation without prior human knowledge and by means of deep reinforcement learning techniques. Since the multirotor is controlled in attitude, no high level state estimation is required. The complete behaviour has been trained with continuous action and state spaces, and has provided proper results (landing at a maximum velocity of 2 m/s), Furthermore, it has been validated in a wide variety of conditions, for both simulated and real-flight scenarios, using a low-cost, lightweight and out-of-the-box consumer multirotor.

AB  - In this paper we propose a particle filter localization approach, based on stereo visual odometry (VO) and semantic information from indoor environments, for mini-aerial robots. The prediction stage of the particle filter is performed using the 3D pose of the aerial robot estimated by the stereo VO algorithm. This predicted 3D pose is updated using inertial as well as semantic measurements. The algorithm processes semantic measurements in two phases; firstly, a pre-trained deep learning (DL) based object detector is used for real time object detections in the RGB spectrum. Secondly, from the corresponding 3D point clouds of the detected objects, we segment their dominant horizontal plane and estimate their relative position, also augmenting a prior map with new detections. The augmented map is then used in order to obtain a drift free pose estimate of the aerial robot. We validate our approach in several real flight experiments where we compare it against ground truth and a state of the art visual SLAM approach.

AB  - Navigation in unknown indoor environments with fast collision avoidance capabilities is an ongoing research topic. Traditional motion planning algorithms rely on precise maps of the environment, where re-adapting a generated path can be highly demanding in terms of computational cost. In this paper, we present a fast reactive navigation algorithm using Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to multi rotor aerial robots. Taking as input the 2D-laser range measurements and the relative position of the aerial robot with respect to the desired goal, the proposed algorithm is successfully trained in a Gazebo-based simulation scenario by adopting an artificial potential field formulation. A thorough evaluation of the trained agent has been carried out both in simulated and real indoor scenarios, showing the appropriate reactive navigation behavior of the agent in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles.

AB  - Obstacle avoidance is a key feature for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. While solutions have been proposed for static obstacle avoidance, systems enabling avoidance of dynamic objects, such as drones, are hard to implement due to the detection range and field-of-view (FOV) requirements, as well as the constraints for integrating such systems on-board small UAVs. In this work, a dataset of 6k synthetic depth maps of drones has been generated and used to train a state-of-the-art deep learning-based drone detection model. While many sensing technologies can only provide relative altitude and azimuth of an obstacle, our depth map-based approach enables full 3D localization of the obstacle. This is extremely useful for collision avoidance, as 3D localization of detected drones is key to perform efficient collision-free path planning. The proposed detection technique has been validated in several real depth map sequences, with multiple types of drones flying at up to 2 m/s, achieving an average precision of 98.7 %, an average recall of 74.7 % and a record detection range of 9.5 meters.

AB  - The development of robots that can dance has received considerable attention. However, they are often either limited to a pre-defined set of movements and music or demonstrate little variance when reacting to external stimuli, such as microphone or camera input. In this paper, we contribute with a novel approach allowing a legged robot to listen to live music while dancing in synchronization with the music in a diverse fashion. This is achieved by extracting the beat from an onboard microphone in real-time, and subsequently creating a dance choreography by picking from a user-generated dance motion library at every new beat. Dance motions include various stepping and base motions. The process of picking from the library is defined by a probabilistic model, namely a Markov chain, that depends on the previously picked dance motion and the current music tempo. Finally, delays are determined online by time-shifting a measured signal and a reference signal, and minimizing the least squares error with the time-shift as parameter. Delays are then compensated for by using a combined feedforward and feedback delay controller which shifts the robot whole-body controller reference input in time. Results from experiments on a quadrupedal robot demonstrate the fast convergence and synchrony to the perceived music.

AB  - We present a novel fruit counting pipeline that combines deep segmentation, frame to frame tracking, and 3D localization to accurately count visible fruits across a sequence of images. Our pipeline works on image streams from a monocular camera, both in natural light, as well as with controlled illumination at night. We first train a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and segment video frame images into fruit and non-fruit pixels. We then track fruits across frames using the Hungarian Algorithm where the objective cost is determined from a Kalman Filter corrected Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) Tracker. In order to correct the estimated count from tracking process, we combine tracking results with a Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm to calculate relative 3D locations and size estimates to reject outliers and double counted fruit tracks. We evaluate our algorithm by comparing with ground-truth human-annotated visual counts. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline is able to accurately and reliably count fruits across image sequences, and the correction step can significantly improve the counting accuracy and robustness. Although discussed in the context of fruit counting, our work can extend to detection, tracking, and counting of a variety of other stationary features of interest such as leaf-spots, wilt, and blossom.

AB  - This paper strives to answer the following question: Is it possible to recognize an intersection when seen from different road segments that constitute the intersection? An intersection or a junction typically is a meeting point of three or four road segments. Its recognition from a road segment that is transverse to or 180 degrees apart from its previous sighting is an extremely challenging and yet a very relevant problem to be addressed from the point of view of both autonomous driving as well as loop detection. This paper formulates this as a problem of video recognition and proposes a novel LSTM based Siamese style deep network for video recognition. For what is indeed a challenging problem and the limited annotated dataset available we show competitive results of recognizing intersections when approached from diverse viewpoints or road segments. Specifically, we tabulate effective recognition accuracy even as the approaches to the intersection being compared are disparate both in terms of viewpoints and weather/illumination conditions. We show competitive results on both synthetic yet highly realistic data mined from the gaming platform GTA as well as on real world data made available through Mapillary.

AB  - An understanding of the nature of objects could help robots to solve both high-level abstract tasks and improve performance at lower-level concrete tasks. Although deep learning has facilitated progress in image understanding, a robot's performance in problems like object recognition often depends on the angle from which the object is observed. Traditionally, robot sorting tasks rely on a fixed top-down view of an object. By changing its viewing angle, a robot can select a more semantically informative view leading to better performance for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce the problem of semantic view selection, which seeks to find good camera poses to gain semantic knowledge about an observed object. We propose a conceptual formulation of the problem, together with a solvable relaxation based on clustering. We then present a new image dataset consisting of around 10k images representing various views of 144 objects under different poses. Finally we use this dataset to propose a first solution to the problem by training a neural network to predict a “semantic score” from a top view image and camera pose. The views predicted to have higher scores are then shown to provide better clustering results than fixed top-down views.

AB  - This paper proposes a distributed deep reinforcement learning (RL) based strategy for a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously fight forest fires. We first model the forest fire as a Markov decision process (MDP) with a factored structure. We consider optimally controlling the forest fire without agents using dynamic programming, and show any exact solution and many approximate solutions are computationally intractable. Given the problem complexity, we consider a deep RL approach in which each agent learns a policy requiring only local information. We show with Monte Carlo simulations that the deep RL policy outperforms a hand-tuned heuristic, and scales well for various forest sizes and different numbers of UAVs as well as variations in model parameters. Experimental demonstrations with mobile robots fighting a simulated forest fire in the Robotarium at the Georgia Institute of Technology are also presented.

AB  - Tree species identification using bark images is a challenging problem that could prove useful for many forestry related tasks. However, while the recent progress in deep learning showed impressive results on standard vision problems, a lack of datasets prevented its use on tree bark species classification. In this work, we present, and make publicly available, a novel dataset called BarkNet 1.0 containing more than 23,000 high-resolution bark images from 23 different tree species over a wide range of tree diameters. With it, we demonstrate the feasibility of species recognition through bark images, using deep learning. More specifically, we obtain an accuracy of 93.88% on single crop, and an accuracy of 97.81% using a majority voting approach on all of the images of a tree. We also empirically demonstrate that, for a fixed number of images, it is better to maximize the number of tree individuals in the training database, thus directing future data collection efforts.

AB  - This paper presents a deep network based unsupervised visual odometry system for 6-DoF camera pose estimation and finding dense depth map for its monocular view. The proposed network is trained using unlabeled binocular stereo image pairs and is shown to provide superior performance in depth and ego-motion estimation compared to the existing state-of-the-art. This is achieved by introducing a novel objective function and training the network using temporally alligned sequences of monocular images. The objective function is based on the Charbonnier penalty applied to spatial and bi-directional temporal reconstruction losses. The overall novelty of the approach lies in the fact that the proposed deep framework combines a disparity-based depth estimation network with a pose estimation network to obtain absolute scale-aware 6-DoF camera pose and superior depth map. According to our knowledge, such a framework with complete unsupervised end-to-end learning has not been tried so far, making it a novel contribution in the field. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through performance comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on KITTI driving dataset.

AB  - We propose a head pose estimation framework that leverages on a recent keypoint detection model. More specifically, we apply the convolutional pose machines (CPMs) to input images, extract different types of facial keypoint features capturing appearance information and keypoint relationships, and train multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for head pose estimation. The benefit of leveraging on the CPMs (which we apply anyway for other purposes like tracking) is that we can design highly efficient models for practical usage. We evaluate our approach on the Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW) dataset and achieve competitive results with the state-of-the-art.

AB  - A topological shape analysis is proposed and utilized to learn concepts that reflect shape commonalities. Our approach is two-fold: i) a spatial topology analysis of point cloud segment constellations within objects. Therein constellations are decomposed and described in an hierarchical manner - from single segments to segment groups until a single group reflects an entire object. ii) a topology analysis of the description space in which segment decompositions are exposed in. Inspired by Persistent Homology, hidden groups of shape commonalities are revealed from object segment decompositions. Experiments show that extracted persistent groups of commonalities can represent semantically meaningful shape concepts. We also show the generalization capability of the proposed approach considering samples of external datasets.

AB  - Technological developments call for increasing perception and action capabilities of robots. Among other skills, vision systems that can adapt to any possible change in the working conditions are needed. Since these conditions are unpredictable, we need benchmarks which allow to assess the generalization and robustness capabilities of our visual recognition algorithms. In this work we focus on robotic kitting in unconstrained scenarios. As a first contribution, we present a new visual dataset for the kitting task. Differently from standard object recognition datasets, we provide images of the same objects acquired under various conditions where camera, illumination and background are changed. This novel dataset allows for testing the robustness of robot visual recognition algorithms to a series of different domain shifts both in isolation and unified. Our second contribution is a novel online adaptation algorithm for deep models, based on batch-normalization layers, which allows to continuously adapt a model to the current working conditions. Differently from standard domain adaptation algorithms, it does not require any image from the target domain at training time. We benchmark the performance of the algorithm on the proposed dataset, showing its capability to fill the gap between the performances of a standard architecture and its counterpart adapted offline to the given target domain.

AB  - 3D LiDARs and 2D cameras are increasingly being used alongside each other in sensor rigs for perception tasks. Before these sensors can be used to gather meaningful data, however, their extrinsics (and intrinsics) need to be accurately calibrated, as the performance of the sensor rig is extremely sensitive to these calibration parameters. A vast majority of existing calibration techniques require significant amounts of data and/or calibration targets and human effort, severely impacting their applicability in large-scale production systems. We address this gap with CalibNet: a geometrically supervised deep network capable of automatically estimating the 6-DoF rigid body transformation between a 3D LiDAR and a 2D camera in real-time. CalibNet alleviates the need for calibration targets, thereby resulting in significant savings in calibration efforts. During training, the network only takes as input a LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding monocular image, and the camera calibration matrix K. At train time, we do not impose direct supervision (i.e., we do not directly regress to the calibration parameters, for example). Instead, we train the network to predict calibration parameters that maximize the geometric and photometric consistency of the input images and point clouds. CalibNet learns to iteratively solve the underlying geometric problem and accurately predicts extrinsic calibration parameters for a wide range of mis-calibrations, without requiring retraining or domain adaptation.

AB  - This paper presents an exploration approach for discovering canonical appearances in unknown environments using an autonomous ground robot equipped with a depth sensor. This approach is based on the previously proposed two-stage algorithm that alternates between local and global decision making for efficient topological mapping based on bubble space representation. Differing from it, the approach aims to identify vantage viewpoints with characterizing views for subsequent appearance-based learning as well as achieving complete coverage. This is demonstrated by a series of experiments using an outdoor benchmark data set including a comparative study with evaluation metrics including the exploration path length and number of canonical appearances discovered.

AB  - This paper discusses deep learning for solving static and dynamic search and recovery tasks - such as the retrieval of all instances of actively moving targets - based on partial-view Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-like sensing. In particular, we demonstrate that abstracted tactic and strategic explorational agency can be implemented effectively via a single deep network that optimises in unity: the mapping of sensory inputs and positional history towards navigational actions. We propose a dual-stream classification paradigm that integrates one Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sensory processing with a second one for interpreting an evolving longterm map memory. In order to learn effective search behaviours given agent location and agent-centric sensory inputs, we train this design against 400k+ optimal navigational decision samples from each set of static and dynamic evolutions for different multi-target behaviour classes. We quantify recovery performance across an extensive range of scenarios; including probabilistic placement and dynamics, as well as fully random target walks and herd-inspired behaviours. Detailed results comparisons show that our design can outperform naive, independent stream and off-the-shelf DRQN solutions. We conclude that the proposed dual-stream architecture can provide a unified, rationally motivated and effective architecture for solving online search tasks in dynamic, multi-target environments. With this paper we publish3 key source code and associated models.

AB  - Visual servoing is a well-known task in robotics. However, there are still challenges when multiple visual sources are combined to accurately guide the robot or occlusions appear. In this paper we present a novel visual servoing approach using hybrid multi-camera input data to lead a robot arm accurately to dynamically moving target points in the presence of partial occlusions. The approach uses four RGBD sensors as Eye-to-Hand (EtoH) visual input, and an arm-mounted stereo camera as Eye-in-Hand (EinH). A Master supervisor task selects between using the EtoH or the EinH, depending on the distance between the robot and target. The Master also selects the subset of EtoH cameras that best perceive the target. When the EinH sensor is used, if the target becomes occluded or goes out of the sensor's view-frustum, the Master switches back to the EtoH sensors to re-track the object. Using this adaptive visual input data, the robot is then controlled using an iterative planner that uses position, orientation and joint configuration to estimate the trajectory. Since the target is dynamic, this trajectory is updated every time-step. Experiments show good performance in four different situations: tracking a ball, targeting a bulls-eye, guiding a straw to a mouth and delivering an item to a moving hand. The experiments cover both simple situations such as a ball that is mostly visible from all cameras, and more complex situations such as the mouth which is partially occluded from some of the sensors.

AB  - Robotic picking of folded objects such as books is required for picking various objects. As a folded object is easily unfolded, it is difficult to carry it stably and place it in a desired pose due to its dangling part. For overcoming this difficulty, we propose a trial-and-error picking system using our Suction Pinching Hand, which can push the dangling part up with pinch grasp until the object lifted with suction grasp is folded. That system utilizes proximity sensors on the hand to predict whether folding will succeed with a current hand pose and decide whether to retry with another pose. Also, proximity sensors, flex sensors and an air pressure sensor are used to deal with uncertainty of the image recognition, the hand hardware and suction grasp. We evaluate our proposed system with experiments of picking and placing folded objects. It is confirmed that our proposed system realizes picking with the ability of our Suction Pinching Hand to carry folded objects stably and place them in desired poses. It is also proved that our proposed system is robust against the uncertainty.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel approach to tightly couple visual and inertial measurements in a fixed-lag visual-inertial odometry (VIO) framework using information sparsification. To bound computational complexity, fixed-lag smoothers typically marginalize out variables, but consequently introduce a densely connected linear prior which significantly deteriorates accuracy and efficiency. Current state-of-the-art approaches account for the issue by selectively discarding measurements and marginalizing additional variables. However, such strategies are sub-optimal from an information-theoretic perspective. Instead, our approach performs a dense marginalization step and preserves the information content of the dense prior. Our method sparsifies the dense prior with a nonlinear factor graph by minimizing the information loss. The resulting factor graph maintains information sparsity, structural similarity, and nonlinearity. To validate our approach, we conduct real-time drone tests and perform comparisons to current state-of-the-art fixed-lag VIO methods in the EuRoC visual-inertial dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive and superior accuracy in almost all trials. We include a detailed run-time analysis to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for real-time applications.

AB  - We present a visual odometry (VO) algorithm for a multi-camera system and robust operation in challenging environments. Our algorithm consists of a pose tracker and a local mapper. The tracker estimates the current pose by minimizing photometric errors between the most recent keyframe and the current frame. The mapper initializes the depths of all sampled feature points using plane-sweeping stereo. To reduce pose drift, a sliding window optimizer is used to refine poses and structure jointly. Our formulation is flexible enough to support an arbitrary number of stereo cameras. We evaluate our algorithm thoroughly on five datasets. The datasets were captured in different conditions: daytime, night-time with near-infrared (NIR) illumination and nighttime without NIR illumination. Experimental results show that a multi-camera setup makes the VO more robust to challenging environments, especially night-time conditions, in which a single stereo configuration fails easily due to the lack of features.

AB  - Place recognition is one of the major challenges for the LiDAR-based effective localization and mapping task. Traditional methods are usually relying on geometry matching to achieve place recognition, where a global geometry map need to be restored. In this paper, we accomplish the place recognition task based on an end-to-end feature learning framework with the LiDAR inputs. This method consists of two core modules, a dynamic octree mapping module that generates local 2D maps with the consideration of the robot's motion; and an unsupervised place feature learning module which is an improved adversarial feature learning network with additional assistance for the long-term place recognition requirement. More specially, in place feature learning, we present an additional Generative Adversarial Network with a designed Conditional Entropy Reduction module to stabilize the feature learning process in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate the proposed method on the Kitti dataset and North Campus Long-Term LiDAR dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art in place recognition tasks under long-term applications. What's more, the feature size and inference efficiency in the proposed method are applicable in real-time performance on practical robotic platforms.

Over the past decades, many impressed SLAM systems have been developed and achieved good performance under certain circumstances. However, some problems are still not well solved, for example, how to tackle the moving objects in the dynamic environments, how to make the robots truly understand the surroundings and accomplish advanced tasks. In this paper, a robust semantic visual SLAM towards dynamic environments named DS-SLAM is proposed. Five threads run in parallel in DS-SLAM: tracking, semantic segmentation, local mapping, loop closing and dense semantic map creation. DS-SLAM combines semantic segmentation network with moving consistency check method to reduce the impact of dynamic objects, and thus the localization accuracy is highly improved in dynamic environments. Meanwhile, a dense semantic octo-tree map is produced, which could be employed for high-level tasks. We conduct experiments both on TUM RGB-D dataset and in real-world environment. The results demonstrate the absolute trajectory accuracy in DS-SLAM can be improved one order of magnitude compared with ORB-SLAM2. It is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high-dynamic environments.

AB  - This paper presents a method for reconstructing globally consistent 3D High-Definition (HD) maps at city scale. Current approaches for eliminating cumulative drift are mainly based on the pose graph optimization under the constraint of scan-matching factors. The misaligned edges in the graph may have negative impacts on the results. To address this problem and further handle inconsistency caused by multi-task acquisitions in urban environments, we introduce a refined structure of the factor graph considering systematical initialization bias, where the scan-matching factors are twice validated through a novel classifier and a robust optimization strategy. In addition, we incorporate a multi-hypothesis extended Kalman filter (MH-EKF) to remove dynamic objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of map quality.

AB  - This paper aims to select features that contribute most to the pose estimation in VO/VSLAM. Unlike existing feature selection works that are focused on efficiency only, our method significantly improves the accuracy of pose tracking, while introducing little overhead. By studying the impact of feature selection towards least squares pose optimization, we demonstrate the applicability of improving accuracy via good feature selection. To that end, we introduce the Max-logDet metric to guide the feature selection, which is connected to the conditioning of least squares pose optimization problem. We then describe an efficient algorithm for approximately solving the NP-hard Max-logDet problem. Integrating Max-logDet feature selection into a state-of-the-art visual SLAM system leads to accuracy improvements with low overhead, as demonstrated via evaluation on a public benchmark.

AB  - Distribution-to-distribution normal distributions transform (NDT-D2D) is one of the fast point set registrations. Since the normal distributions transform (NDT) is a set of normal distributions generated by discrete and regular cells, local minima of the objective function is an issue of NDT-D2D. Also, we found that the objective function based on L2 distance between distributions has a negative correlation with rotational alignment. To overcome the problems, we present a method using dynamic scaling factors of covariances to improve the accuracy of NDT-D2D. Two scaling factors are defined for the preceding and current NDTs respectively, and they are dynamically varied in each iteration of NDT-D2D. We implemented the proposed method based on conventional NDT-D2D and probabilistic NDT-D2D and compared to the NDT-D2D with fixed scaling factors using KITTI benchmark data set. Also, we experimented estimating odometry with an initial guess as an application of distribution-to-distribution probabilistic NDT (PNDT-D2D) with the proposed method. As a result, the proposed method improves both translational and rotational accuracy of the NDT-D2D and PNDT-D2D.

AB  - This paper presents a hybrid 3D-like grid-based mapping approach, that we called HMAP, used as a reliable and efficient 3D representation of the environment surrounding a mobile robot. Considering 3D point-clouds as input data, the proposed mapping approach addresses the representation of height-voxel (HVoxel) elements inside the HMAP, where free and occupied space is modeled through HVoxels, resulting in a reliable method for 3D representation. The proposed method corrects some of the problems inherent to the representation of complex environments based on 2D and 2.5D representations, while keeping an updated grid representation. Additionally, we also propose a complete pipeline for SLAM based on HMAPs. Indoor and outdoor experiments were carried out to validate the proposed representation using data from a Microsoft Kinect One (indoor) and a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR (outdoor). The obtained results show that HMAPs can provide a more detailed view of complex elements in a scene when compared to a classic 2.5D representation. Moreover, validation of the proposed SLAM approach was carried out in an outdoor dataset with promising results, which lay a foundation for further research in the topic.

AB  - External force observer for humanoid robots has been widely studied in the literature. However, most of the proposed approaches generally rely on information from six-axis force/torque sensors, which the small or medium-sized humanoid robots usually do not have. As a result, those approaches cannot be applied to this category of humanoid robots, which is widely used nowadays in education or research. In this paper, we improve the external force observer in [1] to handle the case of an external force applied in any direction and at an arbitrary point of the robot structure. The new observer is based on Kalman filter formulation and it allows the estimation of the three force components. The observer is simple to implement and can easily run in real time using the embedded processor of a medium-sized humanoid robot such as Nao or Darwin-OP. Moreover, the observer does not require any change to the robot hardware as it only uses measurements from the available force-sensing resistors (FSR) inserted under the feet of the humanoid robot and from the robot inertial measurement unit (IMU). The proposed observer was extensively validated on a Nao humanoid robot. In all conducted experiments, the observer successfully estimated the external force within a reasonable margin of error.

AB  - Complex tasks require the combination of both discrete and rhythmic movements. Though scientists do not yet agree on the neural architecture involved in both types and in the transition from one to the other, the importance of having robot controllers able to behave rhythmically and discretely is universally recoanized. In this paper, a bio-inspired robot controller based on oscillating neurons is proposed to realize both discrete and rhythmic movements and easily transition from one to the other. It is shown that, under certain parameter conditions, the CPG controller behaves like a PID controller. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of controlling both discrete and rhythmic movements, the CPG is applied to the initiation of handshaking, namely, reach towards the human hand and start to shake it. Results show that this architecture is suitable for both discrete and rhythmic movements and can easily transition from one to the other.

AB  - Several modeling studies, which address neuromuscular control in impaired unperturbed gaits, were performed to predict human strategies to cope with lateral asymmetries in the body. Experimental studies show different step length and stance time relations between limbs in walking of stroke patients. By extension of a bipedal SLIP (spring-loaded inverted pendulum) based model and the corresponding controllers to 3D space, we focus on different features of the pathologic gaits. The introduced model is based on an extension of the FMCH (force modulated compliant hip) and VBLA (velocity based leg adjustment) model to 3D space. With the proposed model, asymmetric leg and control parameters can result in similar gait patterns as observed in experiments. These parameters comprise hip stiffness and rest angles in FMCH models and the tuning parameter of VBLA for foot placement. It is shown that asymmetries in muscle properties (e.g. stiffness) and leg adjustment can play an important role in generating pathologic gaits.

AB  - A common architecture for torque controlled humanoid robots consists in two nested loops. The outer loop generates desired joint/motor torques, and the inner loop stabilizes these desired values. In doing so, the inner loop usually compensates for joint friction phenomena, thus removing their inherent stabilizing property that may be also beneficial for high level control objectives. This paper shows how to exploit friction for joint and task space control of humanoid robots. Experiments are carried out on the humanoid robot iCub.

AB  - This paper proposes an integration of multi-body and actuator control for multi-contact balancing for robots with highly elastic joints. Inspired by the structure preserving control concept for series-elastic fixed-base robots, the presented approach aims to minimize the control effort by keeping the system structure intact. Balancing on multiple contacts requires to solve the force distribution problem. In locomotion, contacts change quickly, requiring a swift redistribution of contact forces. This is a challenge for elastic robots as the actuator dynamics and limits prevent instantaneous changes of contact forces. The proposed dynamically consistent force distribution is implemented as a model predictive controller which resolves redundancy while complying with contact force and actuator constraints.

AB  - Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.

AB  - Comparing to IK (Inverse Kinematics) based motion control, joint-space motion control is more advantageous in terms of not being restricted by kinematics singularity problem. In this paper, we start with SIMBICON (Simple Biped Locomotion Control) based controller, a joint-space motion control method, extend it for enhancing walking's robustness and versatility. We propose a motion optimization method considering walking robustness, desired walking velocity and energy efficient minimization for walking motion generation. This method enables us to achieve human-like walking motion, which has stretched-knee posture and robust to large push disturbances. We also apply our proposed method to a life-sized biped robot and validate its effectiveness with push recovery and walking on unknown debris experiments.

AB  - The public perception of android robots is a field of growing applied relevance. Currently, most androids are confined within controlled environments rendering interactions between potential end-users, and robots challenging. Even more challenging is for researchers to investigate end-users' perception of androids. We exploit pre-existing YouTube comments as artifacts for quantitative content analysis to gain an indication of social perception on androids. We perform a content analysis of 10301 YouTube comments from four different videos, and reflect on the textual reactions to video stimuli of four extremely human-like android robots. We use text mining and machine learning techniques to process and analyze our corpus. Our findings reveal three equally important topics that should be considered for paving the way towards a robotic society: human-robot relationships, technical specifications, and the science fiction valley. Considering people's attitudes, fears and wishes towards androids, researchers can increase citizen awareness, and engagement.

AB  - Robot-assisted Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR) is currently navigated by 2D fluoroscopy which is insufficiently informative. Previously, a semi-automatic 3D shape instantiation method was developed to instantiate the 3D shape of a main, deployed, and fenestrated stent graft from a single fluoroscopy projection in real-time, which could help 3D FEVAR navigation and robotic path planning. This proposed semi-automatic method was based on the Robust Perspective-S-Point (RP5P) method, graft gap interpolation and semiautomatic multiple-class marker center determination. In this paper, an automatic 3D shape instantiation could be achieved by automatic multiple-class marker segmentation and hence automatic multiple-class marker center determination. Firstly, the markers were designed into five different shapes. Then, Equally-weighted Focal U-Net was proposed to segment the fluoroscopy projections of customized markers into five classes and hence to determine the marker centers. The proposed Equally-weighted Focal U-Net utilized U-Net as the network architecture, equally-weighted loss function for initial marker segmentation, and then equally-weighted focal loss function for improving the initial marker segmentation. This proposed network outperformed traditional Weighted U-Net on the class-imbalance segmentation in this paper with reducing one hyperparameter - the weight. An overall mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.6943 was achieved on 78 testing images, where 81.01 % markers were segmented with a center position error <; 1.6mm. Comparable accuracy of 3D shape instantiation was also achieved and stated. The data, trained models and TensorFlow codes are available on-line.

AB  - Autonomous robotic assisted surgery (RAS) systems aim to reduce human errors and improve patient outcomes leveraging robotic accuracy and repeatability during surgical procedures. However, full automation of RAS in complex surgical environments is still not feasible and collaboration with the surgeon is required for safe and effective use. In this work, we utilize our Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) to develop and evaluate a shared control strategy for the collaboration of the robot with a human operator in surgical scenarios. We consider 2D pattern cutting tasks with partial blood occlusion of the cutting pattern using a robotic electrocautery tool. For this surgical task and RAS system, we i) develop a confidence-based shared control strategy, ii) assess the pattern tracking performances of manual and autonomous controls and identify the confidence models for human and robot as well as a confidence-based control allocation function, and iii) experimentally evaluate the accuracy of our proposed shared control strategy. In our experiments on porcine fat samples, by combining the best elements of autonomous robot controller with complementary skills of a human operator, our proposed control strategy improved the cutting accuracy by 6.4%, while reducing the operator work time to 44% compared to a pure manual control.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel 3D laparoscopic imaging system based on stereo-photogrammetry which is assisted by projecting patterns on the tissue surface. The proposed laparoscopic imaging system has three optic channels, two of which are responsible for stereo vision feedback and the other one is used for coded structured patterns projection. The projected patterns provide the robustness to homogeneous tissue surface since they add more features that can be relied on in the stereo matching. Image fiber bundles (100k pixels) and Gradient-index (GRIN) lenses are utilized to facilitate the remote image acquisition and miniaturization of the laparoscopic probe. Moreover, we adopt a digital micromirror device (DMD) and high-speed cameras to achieve fast pattern switching (up to 4 kHz) and high frame rate image acquisition. The system configuration allows for implementation of the time multiplexing pattern codification strategy in the 3D laparoscopic imaging system to enhance the reliability and resolution of the 3D surface reconstruction. A prototype is established, and various experiments are conducted. Comparative experimental results prove the advantages of our system design. The static and dynamic 3D reconstruction results validate the performance of the proposed 3D laparoscopic imaging system quantitatively and qualitatively.

AB  - Reliable and real-time 3D reconstruction and localization functionality is a crucial prerequisite for the navigation of actively controlled capsule endoscopic robots as an emerging, minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic technology for use in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, we propose a fully dense, non-rigidly deformable, strictly real-time, intraoperative map fusion approach for actively controlled endoscopic capsule robot applications which combines magnetic and vision-based localization, with non-rigid deformations based frame-to-model map fusion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using four different ex-vivo porcine stomach models. Across different trajectories of varying speed and complexity, and four different endoscopic cameras, the root mean square surface reconstruction errors vary from 1.58 to 2.17 cm.

AB  - Alignment of two point clouds is an essential problem in medical robotics and computer-assisted surgery. In this paper, we first formally formulate the generalized point cloud registration problem in a probabilistic manner. Specifically, not only positional but also the orientational information are incorporated into registration. Notably, the positional error is assumed to obey a multivariate Gaussian distribution to accommodate anisotropic cases. Expectation conditional maximization framework is utilized to solve the problem. In E-step, the correspondence probabilities between points in two generalized point clouds are computed. In M -step, the constrained optimization problem with respect to the transformation matrix is re-formulated as an unconstrained one. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art registration methods. The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to noise and outliers, fast convergence speed.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to surgical tool tracking using stereo vision for the da Vinci® Surgical Robotic System. The proposed method is based on robot kinematics, computer vision techniques and Bayesian state estimation. The proposed method employs a silhouette rendering algorithm to create virtual images of the surgical tool by generating the silhouette of the defined tool geometry under the da Vinci® robot endoscopes. The virtual rendering method provides the tool representation in image form, which makes it possible to measure the distance between the rendered tool and real tool from endoscopic stereo image streams. Particle Filter algorithm employing the virtual rendering method is then used for surgical tool tracking. The tracking performance is evaluated on an actual da Vinci® surgical robotic system and a ROS/Gazebo-based simulation of the da Vinci® system.

AB  - This paper presents a parallel robotic mechanism for endoscope tip stabilization and guidance for a robot-assisted minimally invasive laser osteotome. The mechanism attaches to the bone of the patient, providing a stable and robust platform for the laser integrated in the endoscope tip which has to be moved precisely in the sub-millimeter range along a preoperatively planned path. This method is only possible because cutting bone with laser instead of using conventional bone drills and saws involves considerably lower interaction forces. The design, kinematics, control, and motion performance of the concept are presented for an upscaled prototype. The obtained deviation of the endoscope tip motion from the reference path lies in the sub-millimeter range. This result allows us to conclude that the concept is more than promising. Furthermore, we expect that the herein presented principle will influence the way osteotomies will be performed in the future.

AB  - Due to the risks of muscle, bone and neural damage in spinal surgical procedures that require pedicle screw fixation, technological improvements have appeared to help surgeons perform the procedures with higher accuracy. Systems based on optical tracking navigation impose a stringent limitation in the workflow of surgeons since a clear line of sight has to be kept between the cameras and the tracked elements. Other solutions are based on mounting a miniature robot on the spine of the patient, which is very invasive and entails some risks. For these reasons, a novel robotic assisted surgery system capable to guide surgical instruments with minimal deviations compensating patient motion is being developed. This paper presents the system and the electromechanical tracking device used to sense patient motion.

AB  - This paper presents a control architecture readily suitable for surface treatment tasks such as polishing, grinding, finishing or deburring as carried out by a human operator, with the added benefit of accuracy, recurrence and physical strength as administered by a robotic manipulator partner. The shared strategy effectively couples the human operator propioceptive abilities and fine skills through his interactions with the autonomous physical agent. The novel proposed control scheme is based on task prioritization and a non-conventional sliding mode control, which is considered to benefit from its inherent robustness and low computational cost. The system relies on two force sensors, one located between the last link of the robot and the surface treatment tool, and the other located in some place of the robot end-effector: the former is used to suitably accomplish the conditioning task, while the latter is used by the operator to manually guide the robotic tool. When the operator chooses to cease guiding the tool, the robot motion safely switches back to an automatic reference tracking. The paper presents the theories for the novel collaborative controller, whilst its effectiveness for robotic surface treatment is substantiated by experimental results using a redundant 7R manipulator and a mock-up conditioning tool.

AB  - In human-robot collaboration, the robot is required to provide assistance to the user by facilitating task execution. However, due to stability requirements, a well-damped admittance behavior of the robot is necessary during interaction, thus inducing fatigue in the operator. While available schemes involve variable impedance controllers to mitigate this effect, here we propose an alternative approach entailing a proactive robot behavior that assists in the cooperative execution of trajectories towards desired goals, by estimating the user intention. To this end, we make use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict and classify cooperative motions, on the basis of a set of predefined goals in the workspace and model-based generated data of human movements. Manual guidance validation experiments are conducted on a 6 d.o.f. ABB IRB140 industrial robot equipped with a force sensor.

AB  - In this paper, a method for variable admittance control in human-robot cooperation is proposed. A multilayer feedforward neural network is designed using the Cartesian velocity of the robot and the applied force by the operator as its inputs to modify online the virtual damping of the admittance controller. The neural network is trained online using the error backpropagation algorithm based on the error between the velocity of the minimum jerk trajectory model and the measured velocity of the robot. The performance of the proposed controller and the NN generalization ability are evaluated by conducting a point-to-point cooperative motion with multiple subjects using the KUKA LWR robot.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel method for selective management of muscle fatigue in human-robot co-manipulation. The proposed framework enables the detection of excessive fatigue levels of an individual muscle group while executing a certain task, and provides anticipatory robotic responses to distribute the effort among less-fatigued muscles of human arm. Our approach uses a machine learning technique to enable online predictions of muscle forces in different arm configurations and endpoint interaction forces. The estimated muscle forces are then used for the model-based estimation of muscle fatigue levels. Through optimisation, the fatigue management system can alter the task execution in a way that specific fatigued muscles are offloaded, while at the same time enables the production of task force using muscles with lower levels of fatigue. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it can operate online, and that all the measurements are performed by the robot sensory system, which can significantly increase the applicability in real-world scenarios. To validate the proposed method, we performed proof-of-concept experiments where the task of the human operator was to use a tool to polish an object that was manipulated by the robot.

AB  - Given that the success of an interaction task depends on the capability of the robot system to handle physical contact with its environment, pure motion control is often insufficient. This is especially true in the context of medical freehand ultrasound where the human body is a deformable surface and an unstructured environment, representing both a safety concern and a challenge for trajectory planning and control. The systematic tuning of practical high degree-of-freedom physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) tasks is not trivial and there are many parameters to be tuned. While traditional tuning is generally performed ad hoc and requires knowledge of the robot and environment dynamics, we propose a simple and effective online tuning framework using differential evolution (DE) to optimize the motion parameters for parallel force/impedance control in a pHRI and medical ultrasound motion application. Through real-world experiments with a KUKA LBR iiwa 7 R800 collaborative robot, the DE framework tuned motion control for optimal and safe trajectories along a human leg phantom. The optimization process was able to successfully reduce the mean absolute error of the motion contact force to 0.537 N through the evolution of eight motion control parameters.

AB  - This paper presents a system for cooperatively manipulating large objects between a human and a robot. This physical interaction system is designed to handle, transport, or manipulate large objects of different shapes in cooperation with a human. Unique points are the bi-manual physical cooperation, the sequential characteristic of the cooperation including contact changes, and a novel architecture combining force interaction cues, interactive search-based planning, and online trajectory and motion generation. The resulting system implements a mixed initiative collaboration strategy, deferring to the human when his intentions are unclear, and driving the task once understood. This results in an easy and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is evaluated in simulations and on a bi-manual mobile robot with 32 degrees of freedom.

AB  - In this work, we present an adaptive motion planning approach for impedance-controlled robots to modify their tasks based on human physical interactions. We use a class of parameterized time-independent dynamical systems for motion generation where the modulation of such parameters allows for motion flexibility. To adapt to human interactions, we update the parameters of our dynamical system in order to reduce the tracking error (i.e., between the desired trajectory generated by the dynamical system and the real trajectory influenced by the human interaction). We provide analytical analysis and several simulations of our method. Finally, we investigate our approach through real world experiments with a 7-DOF KUKA LWR 4+ robot performing tasks such as polishing and pick-and-place.

AB  - We propose a force-feedback brake pedal with series elastic actuation to preserve the conventional brake pedal feel during cooperative regenerative braking. The novelty of the proposed design is due to the deliberate introduction of a compliant element between the actuator and the brake pedal whose deflections are measured to estimate interaction forces and to perform closed-loop force control. Thanks to its series elasticity, the force-feedback brake pedal can utilize robust controllers to achieve high fidelity force control, possesses favorable output impedance characteristics over the entire frequency spectrum, and can be implemented in a compact package using low-cost components. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed series elastic brake pedal have been tested through human subject experiments that evaluate simulated cooperative regenerative braking scenarios with and without pedal feel compensation. The experimental results and responses to the accompanying questionnaire indicate that pedal feel compensation through the series elastic brake pedal can significantly decrease hard braking instances, improving safety and driver experience.

In this paper, we present a system that integrates a UAS and a digging mechanism which can carry, secure, and install a small sensor into dirt effectively and efficiently. The integrated system includes 1) a low profile, light-weight, inexpensive auger mechanism, 2) a sensor carrying and deploying mechanism with low power consumption, and 3) sensors and software that control and evaluate the auger performance during digging. When tested on a suite of target soils and a target depth of 120mm, the system achieved a success rate of 100% for indoor tests and 92.5% for outdoors, verifying the potential of the approach.

AB  - Many robots make use of gravitational potential energy, generated by another mode, to enhance mobility through gliding locomotion. However, unstructured environments can create situations in which the initial conditions for steady-state gliding cannot be achieved; for example, jumping out of a hole, where the obstacle is very close to the robot. This paper suggests an optimization methodology for finding airfoil configurations and control strategies to maximize the effective non-steady-state gliding ratio for the most challenging initial condition, that of zero velocity. Parameters for the optimization are a location of a robot's center-of-mass in relation to its center-of-pressure and, through the addition of a tail, an active pitch control strategy. The optimal center-of-mass location produces the best passive gliding performance (morphological intelligence), and the optimal control strategy improves the gliding distance. Due to the aerodynamic complexities of modeling the collapsible airfoils, we find the optimal location of the center-of-mass from gliding experiments performed on the robot at different center-of-mass locations and initial pitch angles. An optimal location of the center-of-mass was found to be 40% of the wing chord for our robotic platform; measured from the wing's leading edge. The optimal location has a wide range of initial pitch angles which result in stable, yet non-steady-state, gliding behaviors. The morphological intelligence built into our robotic platform creates two observable dynamic behaviors, that of horizontal velocity gain and sink rate minimization. We then estimate the drag coefficients from the experiments, and conduct dynamic simulations to optimize the pitch control strategy. The design methodology presented here can enhance the non-steady-state gliding performance of a broad range of gliding robots, and the control strategy can further enhance performance on those which utilize an active tail.

AB  - 3D radiation source localization is a common task across applications such as decommissioning, disaster response, and security, but traditional count-based sensors struggle to efficiently disambiguate between symmetries in sensor, source, and environment configurations. Recent works have demonstrated successful passive source localization using a bearing sensor called the Compton gamma camera that can image radiation. This paper first presents an approach to mapping the spatial distribution of radiation with a gamma camera to estimate source locations. An active source localization framework is then developed that greedily selects new waypoints that maximize the Fisher Information provided by the camera's range and bearing observations for source localization. Finally the common assumption of a static step size in between waypoints is relaxed to allow step sizes to adapt online to the observed information. The proposed radiation mapping approach is evaluated in 5×4 m2 and 14×6 m2 laboratory environments, where multiple point sources were localized to within an average of 0.26 m or 0.6% of the environment dimensions. The active source localization approach is evaluated in simulation and an adaptive step size yields a 27% decrease in the localization time and a 16% decrease in the distance traveled to localize a source in a 15×15×15 m3 environment.

AB  - This study presents principle of the camber-flat wing structure conversion mechanism, which is inspired by a dragonfly, and its applicability to MAV. The camber-flat wing structure convert mechanism makes MAV flight using asymmetric flapping pattern through control of angle of attack without complicate structure. This mechanism was inspired from the dragonfly's feature that the camber structure of the wing increases the rigidity of wing structure and makes dragonfly has asymmetric flapping pattern. Experimental results show that MAV has asymmetric flapping pattern that can more stable flight performance when hovering flight with a camber structure and superior performance when the forward flight with a flat structure. The average lift force in the camber wing structure was 0.02N, the average thrust force was 0.02N and the average lift force was 0.011N in the flat wing structure at 20 Hz flapping frequency.

AB  - Automation of inspection and repair tasks on complex installations is gaining attention from industries with high-value assets such as aerospace, nuclear and marine. This paper reports on a five degrees of freedom robotic system capable of performing accurate and repeatable repair procedures through a narrow inspection port, which minimizes the cost and downtime associated with unscheduled maintenance. Careful study of the target working volume and repair process informed the design of a robotic probe capable of replicating the operation. Kinematic analysis of the robot's flexible, prismatic and rotary joints was used to define accurate machining paths in 3D space, and the results were verified using an optical motion capture system (accuracy of 0.25 mm). After comprehensive verifications of the constitutive elements, the robotic system was successfully demonstrated for repair of a high-pressure compressor aerofoil in a gas turbine. The results not only proves the ability of the system to address such difficult repair scenarios but also highlights a domain of opportunities in developing specialist robotics for repair of high-value assets, which is a subject to growing global demand.

AB  - Underground mines are a dangerous working environment and, therefore, robots could help putting less humans at risk. Traditional robots, sensors, and software often do not work reliably underground due to the harsh environment. This paper analyzes requirements and presents a robot design capable of navigating autonomously underground and manipulating objects with a robotic arm. The robot's base is a robust four wheeled platform powered by electric motors and able to withstand the harsh environment. It is equipped with color and depth cameras, lighting, laser scanners, an inertial measurement unit, and a robotic arm. We conducted two experiments testing mapping and autonomous navigation. Mapping a 75 meters long route including a loop closure results in a map that qualitatively matches the original map to a good extent. Testing autonomous driving on a previously created map of a second, straight, 150 meters long route was also successful. However, without loop closure, rotation errors cause apparent deviations in the created map. These first experiments showed the robot's operability underground.

AB  - In this paper we tackle the problem of finding the source of a gaseous leak with a robot in a three-dimensional (3-D) physical space. The proposed method extends the operational range of the probabilistic Infotaxis algorithm [1] into 3-D and makes multiple improvements in order to increase its performance in such settings. The method has been tested systematically through high-fidelity simulations and in a wind tunnel emulating realistic conditions. The impact of multiple algorithmic and environmental parameters has been studied in the experiments. The algorithm shows good performance in various environmental conditions, particularly in high wind speeds and different source release rates.

AB  - With the advancements in robotic technology and the progress in human-robot interaction research, the interest in deploying mixed human-robot teams in rescue missions is increasing. Due to their complementary capabilities in terms of locomotion, visibility and reachability of areas, human-robot teams are considerably deployed in real-world settings, albeit the robotic agents in such scenarios are normally fully teleoperated. A major barrier to successful and efficient mission execution in those teams is the lack of cognitive skills in robotic systems. In this paper, we present a cognition-enabled framework and an implemented system where robotic agents are equipped with cognitive capabilities to naturally communicate with humans and autonomously perform tasks. The framework allows for natural tasking of robots, reasoning about robot behavior, capabilities and actions, and a common belief state representation for shared mission awareness of robots and human operators.

AB  - The subject of this paper is about the use of a suspended Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) for pick-and-place operations of heavy and heterogeneous objects. The knowledge of the payload mass and its center of mass in realtime is an asset for robust control of the device, which is required to ensure a good stability, especially when the objects have different shapes, sizes and masses. Accordingly, this paper aims at experimentally evaluating the effects of (i) the pulleys modeling and (ii) the use of force sensors for the payload estimation. It turns out that the consideration of the pulleys into the geometric model of the robot improves the mass and center of mass estimations of the payload. A comparison is made between the estimation of cable tensions from force sensors and from motor currents. Finally, a torque controller with a feedforward term for real-time mass compensation is proposed and implemented on a CDPR prototype.

AB  - Flexure-based finger joints for prosthetic hands have been studied, but until now they lack stiffness and load bearing capacity. In this paper we present a design which combines large range of motion, stiffness and load bearing capacity, with an overload protection mechanism. Several planar and non-planar hinge topologies are studied to determine load capacity over the range of motion. Optimized topologies are compared, in 30 degrees deflected state, in terms of stresses by deflection and grasping forces. Additionally, support stiffnesses were computed for all hinges in the whole range of motion (45 degrees). The Hole Cross Hinge presented the best performance over the range of motion with a grasping force up to 15 N while deflected 30 degrees. A new concept, the Angle Three-Flexure Cross Hinge, provides outstanding performance for deflections from 17.5 up to 30 degrees with a 20 N maximum grasping force when fully deflected. Experimental verification of the support stiffness over the range of motion shows some additional compliances, but the stiffness trend of the printed hinge is in line with the model. The presented joints power grasping capability outperform current state flexure-base hands and are comparable to commercial non-flexure-based prosthetic hands. In the event of excessive loads, an overload protection mechanism is in place to protect the flexure- hinges.

AB  - This paper presents a body-mounted, four degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) parallel mechanism robot for image-guided percutaneous interventions. The design of the robot is optimized to be light weight and compact such that it could be mounted to the patient body. It has a modular design that can be adopted for assisting various image-guided, needle-based percutaneous interventions such as arthrography, biopsy and brachytherapy seed placement. The robot mechanism and the control system are designed and manufactured with components compatible with imaging modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). The current version of the robot presented in this paper is optimized for shoulder arthrography under MRI guidance; a Z-shaped fiducial frame is attached to the robot, providing accurate and repeatable robot registration with the MR scanner coordinate system. Here we present the mechanical design of the manipulator, robot kinematics, robot calibration procedure, and preliminary bench-top accuracy assessment. The bench-top accuracy evaluation of the robotic manipulator shows average translational error of 1.01 mm and 0.96 mm in X and Z axes, respectively, and average rotational error of 3.06 degrees and 2.07 degrees about the X and Z axes, respectively.

AB  - This paper introduces the design of a novel under-actuated hand with highly integrated modular finger units, which can be easily reconfigured in terms of finger arrangement and number to account for the manipulation needs of different applications. Each finger module is powered by a single actuator through an under-actuated transmission and equipped with a sensory system for delicate and precise grasping, which includes absolute position measurements, contact pressure sensing at finger phalanxes and motor current readings. Finally, intrinsic elasticity integrated in the transmission system make the hand robust and adaptive to impacts when interacting with the objects and environment. This highly integrated hand (HERI II) was developed for the Centauro Robot to enable robust and resilient manipulation. A set of experiments demonstrating the hand's grasping performance were carried out and fully verified the design effectiveness of the proposed hand.

AB  - In this paper we present the design of a hybrid robotic arm using soft, inflatable bladders for actuation. Low cost switching valves are used for pressure control, where the valve model is identified experimentally. A model of the robotic arm is derived based on system identification and used to derive a linear quadratic Gaussian controller. A method to solve limitations of the employed switching valves is proposed and experimentally proven to improve tracking performance. The closed loop control performance of the robotic arm is demonstrated by stabilizing a rotational inverted pendulum known as the Furuta pendulum.

AB  - Vibro-driven robotic (VDR) systems use stick-slip motions for locomotion. Due to the underactuated nature of the system, efficient design and control are still open problems. We present a new energy preserving design based on a spring-augmented pendulum. We indirectly control the friction-induced stick-slip motions by exploiting the passive dynamics in order to achieve an improvement in overall travelling distance and energy efficiency. Both collocated and non-collocated constraint conditions are elaborately analysed and considered to obtain a desired trajectory generation profile. For tracking control, we develop a partial feedback controller for the driving pendulum which counteracts the dynamic contributions from the platform. Comparative simulation studies show the effectiveness and intriguing performance of the proposed approach, while its feasibility is experimentally verified through a physical robot. Our robot is to the best of our knowledge the first nonlinear-motion prototype in literature towards the VDR systems.

AB  - Sensed information greatly helps a robot to adjust its motion or modulate the locomotory behavior. While many sensing components have been developed for macroscale robots, such off-the-shelf sensors are hardly integrated with a mesoscale (i.e., 0.1 mm to 10 mm) robot due to the size limitation. In this work, we propose a Compliant Mechanosensory Composite (CMC) to fabricate a small compliant mechanism with embedded sensing ability. As the first demonstration of CMC, we directly print a conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS onto the flexible joint of a compliant mechanism to sense the motion of the flexible joint itself. Owing to the variation of electric contact resistance (ECR) upon bending, the CMC could estimate its bending angle. The performance of the CMC was verified by analyzing the cyclic bending, transient and stationary response. Overall, a sparsely printed serpentine pattern with thicker line exhibited consistent response without a noticeable hysteresis. To demonstrate the applicability of the CMC process, a small gripper actuated by a SMA (shape memory alloy) coil was fabricated, and its motion was successfully measured using the embedded sensors. We expect the proposed CMC will enable a small robot to become sensible at its self motion, external load, and physical contacts in future.
