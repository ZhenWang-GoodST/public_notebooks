AB  - Robots mounted on an unmanned chaser satellite could be used for performing rendezvous and grasping manoeuvres in order to repair satellites or remove space debris from orbit. Use of manipulators for such purposes is challenging, since the performed task need to be done autonomously, accurately and with high level of robustness. During manoeuvres high disturbances might appear e.g. due to contact between the manipulator arm end-effector and the target spacecraft. In this paper an approach for validation of the robotic subsystem during chaser rendezvous and grasping manoeuvre has been shown. Two type of testbed systems were used: planar air-bearing microgravity simulators and a test-bed system with industrial robots. The proposed approach took advantage of possible replacement of particular subsystem in reference model or reference hardware in specified test-bed system. The list of tests performed are included in the paper.

AB  - This paper proposes real-time collision-based contact mode estimation with only a force-torque sensor for capturing a moving rigid body. The contact modes are defined for determining when to generate the signal to close the robotic hand for establishing object closure. In our particle filter approach, collision-triggered filter is used to determine the contact mode with the least amount of computation. Brach's collision model is used for our collision model-based approach for a rigid body because it is computationally light-weighted and enables the sampling of three collision properties for the particle filter. The validity of our method is experimentally demonstrated by achieving the highest success rate using the reasonable computation resources required (average of 3.9 milliseconds and worst of 6.1 milliseconds with our setup), and verifying each computation resource (or number of particles) based on the size of motion estimation error in the pre-capture phase.

AB  - When a space robot accidentally or voluntarily comes in contact with a target object, a workspace shift happens due to exchange of momentum between the objects. The problem of workspace adjustment is addressed herein. A novel controller is derived to simultaneously adjust the workspace and control the end-effector pose. The controller is based on a center-of-mass (CoM) regulation which fixes the workspace in the inertial space while leaving the base free to move, resulting in fuel efficiency. The control is validated on hardware using a robotic simulator composed of a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm mounted on a 6DOF moving base.

AB  - We present a collaborative visual localization method for rovers designed to hop and tumble across the surface of small Solar System bodies, such as comets and asteroids. In a two-phase approach, an orbiting primary spacecraft first maps the surface of a body by capturing images from various poses and illumination angles; these images are processed to create a prior map of 3D landmarks. In the second phase, a hopping rover is deployed to the surface where it uses a camera to relocalize to the prior map and to perform onboard visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Small bodies present several unique challenges to existing visual SLAM algorithms, such as high-contrast shadows that move quickly over the surface due to the short (e.g. 1-12 hour) rotational periods, and large changes in visual appearance between orbit and the surface, where image scale varies by many orders of magnitude (kilometers to centimeters). In this work, we describe how to augment ORB-SLAM2-a state of the art visual SLAM implementation-to handle large variations in illumination by fusing prior images with varying illumination angles. We demonstrate how a hopping rover can use a wide field of view (FOV) camera to relocalize to prior maps captured by an orbiting spacecraft with a narrow FOV camera, and how the growth of pose and scale errors can be bounded by periodic loop closures during large hops. The proposed method is evaluated with sequences of images captured around a mock asteroid; it is shown to be robust to varying illumination angles, scene scale changes, and off-nadir camera pointing angles.

AB  - For achieving a successful mission in lunar exploration, not only traversability of exploration rover should be predicted but also operation environment should be considered under the limited power condition. Therefore, an optimal design of rover wheel for minimizing power consumption and maximizing tractive performance is required by conducting conceptual design stage. This paper describes settlement of requirements at system level and modeling of operation environment such as power acquisition and terrain characteristics in the lunar simulant. Using the wheel-terrain interaction model, a wheel design methodology was proposed to obtain an optimal wheel dimension, which meet the limited power condition along with maximal trafficability according to the each landing site. In addition, the results from the above approach have been validated with the experimental results using a single wheel test bed on the lunar simulant.

AB  - Future planetary rovers will gain the ability to manipulate their environment in addition to the maneuverability of current systems. For dedicated contact interaction, Cartesian impedance control is a well-established approach from numerous terrestrial applications. In this paper we will present a whole-body Cartesian impedance controller for a planetary rover equipped with a robotic arm. In contrast to classical terrestrial whole-body controllers, the issue of proper wheel force distribution will be addressed within the control framework. A global optimization solves this redundancy in the over-actuation of the mobile base while additionally handling the kinematic redundancy in the serial kinematic sub-chain of the robot. The approach is experimentally validated on the DLR Lightweight Rover Unit. It can be used for versatile manipulation in rough terrain such as encountered in planetary exploration or terrestrial search-and-rescue scenarios.

AB  - We introduce a method to optimize on a patient-specific basis the kinematic design of the Continuum Reconfigurable Incisionless Surgical Parallel (CRISP) robot, a needle-diameter medical robot based on a parallel structure that is capable of performing minimally invasive procedures. Our objective is to maximize the ability of the robot's tip camera to view tissue surfaces in constrained spaces. The kinematic design of the CRISP robot, which greatly influences its ability to perform a task, includes parameters that are fixed before the procedure begins, such as entry points into the body and parallel structure connection points. We combine a global stochastic optimization algorithm, Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), with a motion planner designed specifically for the CRISP robot. ASA facilitates exploration of the robot's design space while the motion planner enables evaluation of candidate designs based on their ability to successfully view target regions on a tissue surface. By leveraging motion planning, we ensure that the evaluation of a design only considers motions which do not collide with the patient's anatomy. We analytically show that the method asymptotically converges to a globally optimal solution and demonstrate our algorithm's ability to optimize kinematic designs of the CRISP robot on a patient-specific basis.

AB  - This paper presents a six-limb high-speed parallel robot for pick-and-place operations that is based on two Delta robots, where the two sub-platforms are connected by a gearbox. Unlike the current 6-axis Delta-type robot, all the actuators of the robot are mounted on a base platform, allowing to reduce the inertia for high dynamic performance. Besides the 3-axis translations, the three rotations of the robot end-effector are realized by the differential motions of the two sub-platforms in three directions for large orientational workspace, but without significantly increased structural complexity of gearbox, compared to the existing one. The kinematic problems are studied to reveal that the workspace volume of the robot is similar to the commercial Delta-type robots. The simplified dynamic model is established and the simulation results show that the robot can reach up to a 20G acceleration subject to the commercial actuation combination.

AB  - In the present paper we discuss a novel dynamic controller for Cable Driven Parallel Robots, based on the Backstepping technique. The main challenge in controlling these robots, is expressing the dynamic equilibrium with respect to the joint variables. This drawback makes the definition of closed-loop controllers more challenging, in comparison with their serial counterparts. The problem is tackled by considering redundant dynamics, expressed in both task and joints space and solved through the method of quasi-velocity. We propose the usage of the observer linearization to estimate the end effector pose and stiffness, by just measuring the motor position, velocity and torque. These variables are used in the feedback loop to control the pose of the end effector. A 3-tendon planar platform is used for the experimental analysis.

AB  - The moving platform of a conventional parallel mechanism is typically connected to the ground link via serial kinematic chains or limbs. When interconnections are created among the limbs, they form coupling sub-chains that can provide additional constraints to the motion of the platform. The resulting complex mechanism offers the potential for improved performance and functionality of the overall mechanism. The basic building block of the parallel mechanism with coupling sub-chain is found to be a two-loop mechanism. This paper presents a screw theory based general method for synthesizing two-loop mechanism by adding an open chain on top of an existing closed chain for a specified combination of rotational and translational degrees of freedom of the end-effector. A comprehensive set of two-loop mechanisms have been presented for various combinations of rotational and translational degrees of freedom.

AB  - Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) have several advantages over conventional parallel manipulators most notably a large workspace. CDPRs whose workspace can be further increased by modification of the geometric architecture are known as Reconfigurable Cable Driven Parallel Robots(RCDPRs). A novel concept of RCDPRs, known as Mobile CDPR (MCDPR) that consists of a CDPR carried by multiple mobile bases, is studied in this paper. The system is capable of autonomously navigating to a desired location then deploying to a standard CDPR. In this paper, we analyze the Static equilibrium (SE) of the mobile bases when the system is fully deployed. In contrast to classical CDPRs we show that the workspace of the MCDPR depends, not only on the tension limits, but on the SE constraints as well. We demonstrate how to construct the Available Wrench Set (AWS) for a planar MCDPR wih a point-mass end-effector using both the convex hull and Hyperplane shifting methods. The obtained results are validated in simulation and on an experimental platform consisting of two mobile bases and a CDPR with four cables.

AB  - In general, it is not possible to determine the actual manipulator platform's pose of a parallel mechanism from its active joints' coordinates. This problem is usually solved by using additional numerical procedures or by additional system information from auxiliary sensors, providing several weaknesses including initial pose estimations, reference drives, or workspace limitations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a closed-form solution for the direct kinematics problem of the planar 3-RPR parallel mechanism by using only the orientations of two active joints and the manipulator platform, where P denotes active prismatic joints and R passive revolute joints.

AB  - The forward kinematics of the Gough-Stewart platform, and their simplified versions in which some leg endpoints coalesce, has been typically solved using variable elimination methods. In this paper, we cast doubts on whether this is the easiest way to solve the problem. We will see how the indirect approach in which the length of some extra virtual legs is first computed leads to important simplifications. In particular, we provide a procedure to solve 30 out of 34 possible topologies for a Gough-Stewart platform without variable elimination.

AB  - Handling loop closures and intervehicle observations in cooperative robotic scenarios remains a challenging problem due to data consistency, bandwidth limitations and increased computation requirements. This paper develops a general cooperative localisation and single vehicle Visual SLAM framework that includes direct intervehicle observations and pose to pose loop closures on each vehicle with states shared as required. This fuses single vehicle SLAM with cooperative localisation and avoids data association of map data across limited communication networks. The base problem is developed as a factor graph with each vehicle solving local subgraphs that are split based on intervehicle observations. We modify the order of variable elimination in subgraphs through manipulation of the square-root of the Information matrix to extract updates that include the historic states involved in the loop closures and do not require transmission of other states not involved in the measurement or retransmission of previously shared states. We demonstrate the effect on localisation accuracy and bandwidth using data captured from a set of five robots observing each other and landmarks compared to both single vehicle SLAM, pure cooperative localisation and a centralised solution.

AB  - Scale recovery is one of the essential problems for monocular visual odometry. The camera height is usually used as an absolute reference to recover the scale. In this case, the precision of scale recovery depends on the accuracy of the road region detection and road geometrical model calculation. In previous works, road detection and road geometrical model calculation are solved sequentially: the road geometrical model calculation is based on the road detection and the road region detection is based on the color information. However, the color information of a road is not stable enough. In the proposed method, the estimated road geometrical model is taken into consideration to detect the road region as a feedback. Therefore, the road region detection and road geometrical model estimation can benefit each other. Delaunay Triangulation method is used to segment an input image to many triangles with the matched feature points as vertices. Every triangle region is classified as a road region or not by comparing their geometrical model with that of the road and the road geometrical model is updated online. We evaluate our visual odometry scale recovery method on the KITTI dataset and the results show that our method is achieving the best performance among all existing monocular visual odometry scale recovery methods without additional sensors.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel method to detect and resolve motion conflicts in visual-inertial odometry. Recently, it has been common to integrate an IMU sensor with visual odometry in order to improve localization accuracy and robustness. However, when a disagreement between the two sensor modalities occurs, the localization accuracy reduces drastically and leads to irreversible errors. In such conditions, multiple motion estimates based on the set of observations used are possible. This creates a conflict (motion conflict) in determining which observations to use for accurate ego-motion estimation. Therefore, we present a method to detect motion conflicts based on per-frame positional estimate discrepancy and per-landmark reprojection errors. Additionally, we also present a method to resolve motion conflicts by eliminating inconsistent IMU and landmark measurements. Finally, we implement Motion Conflict aware Visual Inertial Odometry (MC-VIO) by combining both detection and resolution of motion conflicts. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation of MC-VIO on visually and inertially challenging datasets. Experimental results indicate that the MC-VIO algorithm reduces the increase in absolute trajectory error by 80% and the relative pose error by 60% for scenes with motion conflict, in comparison to the state-of-the-art reference VIO algorithm.

AB  - During localization and mapping the success of point cloud registration can be compromised when there is an absence of geometric features or constraints in corridors or across doorways, or when the volumes scanned only partly overlap, due to occlusions or constrictions between subsequent observations. This work proposes a strategy to predict and prevent laser-based localization failure. Our solution relies on explicit analysis of the point cloud content prior to registration. A model predicting the risk of a failed alignment is learned by analysing the degree of spatial overlap between two input point clouds and the geometric constraints available within the region of overlap. We define a novel measure of alignability for these constraints. The method is evaluated against three real-world datasets and compared to baseline approaches. The experiments demonstrate how our approach can help improve the reliability of laser-based localization during exploration of unknown and cluttered man-made environments.

AB  - We present a method of improving visual place recognition and metric localisation under very strong appearance change. We learn an invertable generator that can transform the conditions of images, e.g. from day to night, summer to winter etc. This image transforming filter is explicitly designed to aid and abet feature-matching using a new loss based on SURF detector and dense descriptor maps. A network is trained to output synthetic images optimised for feature matching given only an input RGB image, and these generated images are used to localize the robot against a previously built map using traditional sparse matching approaches. We benchmark our results using multiple traversals of the Oxford RobotCar Dataset over a year-long period, using one traversal as a map and the other to localise. We show that this method significantly improves place recognition and localisation under changing and adverse conditions, while reducing the number of mapping runs needed to successfully achieve reliable localisation.

AB  - Motivated by applications in multirobot team selection, in this paper, we present a novel algorithm for computing optimal solution of chance-constrained 0-1 knapsack problem. In this variation of the knapsack problem, the objective function is deterministic but the weights of the items are stochastic and therefore the knapsack constraint is stochastic. We convert the chance-constrained knapsack problem to a two-dimensional discrete optimization problem on the variance-mean plane, where each point on the plane can be identified with an assignment of items to the knapsack. By exploiting the geometry of the non-convex feasible region of the chance-constrained knapsack problem in the variance-mean plane, we present a novel deterministic technique to find an optimal solution by solving a sequence of deterministic knapsack problems (called risk-averse knapsack problem). We apply our algorithm to a multirobot team selection problem to cover a given route, where the length of the route is much larger than the length each individual robot can fly and the length that an individual robot can fly is a random variable (with known mean and variance). We present simulation results on randomly generated data to demonstrate that our approach is scalable with both the number of robots and increasing uncertainty of the distance an individual robot can travel.

AB  - We present an algorithm for selecting when to communicate during online planning phases of coordinated multi-robot missions. The key idea is that a robot decides to request communication from another robot by reasoning over the predicted information value of communication messages over a sliding time-horizon, where communication messages are probability distributions over action sequences. We formulate this problem in the context of the recently proposed decentralised Monte Carlo tree search (Dec-MCTS) algorithm for online, decentralised multi-robot coordination. We propose a particle filter for predicting the information value, and a polynomial-time belief-space planning algorithm for finding the optimal communication schedules in an online and decentralised manner. We evaluate the benefit of informative communication planning for a multi-robot information gathering scenario with 8 simulated robots. Our results show reductions in channel utilisation of up to four-fifths with surprisingly little impact on coordination performance.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of multi-robot realization. A realization is a set of robot positions where pairwise distances are either bounded from above or from below by a given adjacency threshold - depending on whether the respective robot pairs are to be adjacent or not. In the realization problem, unlike the related coordinated navigation or formation control problems, exact goal positions or relative distances need not be specified. Rather, only pairwise adjacency constraints are given and the robots' positions are required to satisfy these constraints. Applications of realization problem include multi-robots involved in team games (playing soccer, etc), patrolling and area coverage. We present a novel solution to this problem in which the robots simultaneously navigate to find a realization of a given adjacency matrix without colliding with each other along the way. In this solution, complete information about pairwise distances and free configuration space are encoded using an artificial potential function over the cross product space of the robots' simultaneous positions and proximity variables. The closed-loop dynamics governing the motion of each velocity-controlled robot take the form of the appropriate projection of the gradient of this function while pairwise distances are adjusted accordingly. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach has considerably higher realization percentage and shorter movement distances in comparison to a standard 2-stage approach.

AB  - We present a framework to enable a fleet of rigidly attached quadrotor aerial robots to transport heavy objects along a known reference trajectory without inter-robot communication or centralized coordination. Leveraging a distributed wrench controller, we provide exponential stability guarantees for the entire assembly, under a mild geometric condition. This is achieved by each quadrotor independently solving a local optimization problem to counteract the biased torque effects from each robot in the assembly. We rigorously analyze the controllability of the object, design a distributed compensation scheme to address these challenges, and show that the resulting strategy collectively guarantees full group control authority. To ensure feasibility for online implementation, we derive bounds on the net desired control wrench, characterize the output wrench space of each quadrotor, and perform subsequent trajectory optimization under these input constraints. We thoroughly validate our method in simulation with eight quadrotors transporting a heavy object in a cluttered environment subject to various sources of uncertainty, and demonstrate the algorithm's resilience.

AB  - In this paper, we formulate an environmental sensing problem for multi-robot teams that couples intermittent deployments with the selection of team composition and sensor type over time. We suppose that a multi-robot team needs to autonomously sense an environmental process and find the optimal policy for deploying heterogeneous robots. In addition, heterogeneous robot teams can be composed in various ways by selecting different mobility and sensor types which have varying accuracies and costs, resulting in a more complex problem. The question is then how to find an optimal intermittent deployment and sensor selection policy that captures both cost and estimation accuracy based on partial environmental information. By utilizing structural results from partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) and exploiting submodularity, an optimal policy, which minimizes cost while maintaining a high accuracy, can be achieved in this paper. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by simulation results and comparisons with naive policies.

The ground robots rigidly grasp a load, while the aerial vehicles are attached to the object through non-rigid inextensible cables. The idea behind such a heterogeneous multi-robot system is to benefit of the advantages of both types of robots that might be the precision of ground robots, the increased payload of multiple aerial vehicles and their larger workspace. The overall model of the system is derived and its expression and redundancy are exploited by setting a general constrained optimal planning problem. The problem is herein solved by dynamic programming and simulation results validated the proposed scheme.

AB  - Field multi-robot missions face numerous unavoidable disturbances, such as delays in executing tasks and intermittent communications. Coping with such disturbances requires to endow the robots with high-level decision skills. We present a distributed decision architecture based first on a hybrid planner that can manage decentralized repairs with partial communication, and secondly on a distributed execution algorithm that efficiently propagates delays. This architecture has been successfully experimented on the field for the achievement of surveillance missions involving eight (8) real autonomous aerial and ground robots.

AB  - Modeling realistic human joint limits is important for applications involving physical human-robot interaction. However, setting appropriate human joint limits is challenging because it is pose-dependent: the range of joint motion varies depending on the positions of other bones. The paper introduces a new technique to accurately simulate human joint limits in physics simulation. We propose to learn an implicit equation to represent the boundary of valid human joint configurations from real human data. The function in the implicit equation is represented by a fully connected neural network whose gradients can be efficiently computed via back-propagation. Using gradients, we can efficiently enforce realistic human joint limits through constraint forces in a physics engine or as constraints in an optimization problem.

AB  - Conventional approaches of robotic writing of Chinese character strokes often suffer from limited font generation methods, and thus the writing results often lack of diversity. This has seriously restricted the high quality writing ability of robots. This paper proposes a generative adversarial nets-based calligraphic robotic framework, which enables a robot to learn writing fundamental Chinese strokes with rich diversity and good originality. In particular, the framework considers the learning process of robotic writing as an adversarial procedure which is implemented by three interactive modules including a stroke generation module, a stroke discriminative module and a training module. Noting that the stroke generative module included in the conventional generative adversarial nets cannot solve the non-differentiable problem, the policy gradient commonly used in reinforcement learning is thus adapted in this work to train the generative module by regarding the outputs from the discriminative module as rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework allows a calligraphic robot to successfully write fundamental Chinese strokes with good quality in various styles. The experiment also suggests the proposed approach can achieve human-level stroke writing quality without the requirement of a performance evaluation system. This approach therefore significantly boosts the robotic autonomous creation ability.

AB  - We present an approach for mobile robots to learn to navigate in dynamic environments with pedestrians via raw depth inputs, in a socially compliant manner. To achieve this, we adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) strategy, which improves upon a pre-trained behavior cloning policy. Our approach overcomes the disadvantages of previous methods, as they heavily depend on the full knowledge of the location and velocity information of nearby pedestrians, which not only requires specific sensors, but also the extraction of such state information from raw sensory input could consume much computation time. In this paper, our proposed GAIL-based model performs directly on raw depth inputs and plans in real-time. Experiments show that our GAIL-based approach greatly improves the safety and efficiency of the behavior of mobile robots from pure behavior cloning. The real-world deployment also shows that our method is capable of guiding autonomous vehicles to navigate in a socially compliant manner directly through raw depth inputs. In addition, we release a simulation plugin for modeling pedestrian behaviors based on the social force model.

AB  - Imitation learning is an effective approach for autonomous systems to acquire control policies when an explicit reward function is unavailable, using supervision provided as demonstrations from an expert, typically a human operator. However, standard imitation learning methods assume that the agent receives examples of observation-action tuples that could be provided, for instance, to a supervised learning algorithm. This stands in contrast to how humans and animals imitate: we observe another person performing some behavior and then figure out which actions will realize that behavior, compensating for changes in viewpoint, surroundings, object positions and types, and other factors. We term this kind of imitation learning “imitation-from-observation,” and propose an imitation learning method based on video prediction with context translation and deep reinforcement learning. This lifts the assumption in imitation learning that the demonstration should consist of observations in the same environment configuration, and enables a variety of interesting applications, including learning robotic skills that involve tool use simply by observing videos of human tool use. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in learning a wide range of real-world robotic tasks modeled after common household chores from videos of a human demonstrator, including sweeping, ladling almonds, pushing objects as well as a number of tasks in simulation.

AB  - In realistic environments, fully specifying a task model such that a robot can perform a task in all situations is impractical. In this work, we present Incremental Task Modification via Corrective Demonstrations (ITMCD), a novel algorithm that allows a robot to update a learned model by making use of corrective demonstrations from an end-user in its environment. We propose three different types of model updates that make structural changes to a finite state automaton (FSA) representation of the task by first converting the FSA into a state transition auto-regressive hidden Markov model (STARHMM). The STARHMM's probabilistic properties are then used to perform approximate Bayesian model selection to choose the best model update, if any. We evaluate ITMCD Model Selection in a simulated block sorting domain and the full algorithm on a real-world pouring task. The simulation results show our approach can choose new task models that sufficiently incorporate new demonstrations while remaining as simple as possible. The results from the pouring task show that ITMCD performs well when the modeled segments of the corrective demonstrations closely comply with the original task model.

AB  - We propose a self-supervised approach for learning representations and robotic behaviors entirely from unlabeled videos recorded from multiple viewpoints, and study how this representation can be used in two robotic imitation settings: imitating object interactions from videos of humans, and imitating human poses. Imitation of human behavior requires a viewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between end-effectors (hands or robot grippers) and the environment, object attributes, and body pose. We train our representations using a triplet loss, where multiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the embedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often visually similar but functionally different. This signal causes our model to discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint, but do change across time, while ignoring nuisance variables such as occlusions, motion blur, lighting and background. We demonstrate that this representation can be used by a robot to directly mimic human poses without an explicit correspondence, and that it can be used as a reward function within a reinforcement learning algorithm. While representations are learned from an unlabeled collection of task-related videos, robot behaviors such as pouring are learned by watching a single 3rd-person demonstration by a human. Reward functions obtained by following the human demonstrations under the learned representation enable efficient reinforcement learning that is practical for real-world robotic systems. Video results, open-source code and dataset are available at sermanet.github.io/imitate.

AB  - In order to robustly execute a task under environmental uncertainty, a robot needs to be able to reactively adapt to changes arising in its environment. The environment changes are usually reflected in deviation from expected sensory traces. These deviations in sensory traces can be used to drive the motion adaptation, and for this purpose, a feedback model is required. The feedback model maps the deviations in sensory traces to the motion plan adaptation. In this paper, we develop a general data-driven framework for learning a feedback model from demonstrations. We utilize a variant of a radial basis function network structure -with movement phases as kernel centers- which can generally be applied to represent any feedback models for movement primitives. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we test it on the task of scraping on a tilt board. In this task, we are learning a reactive policy in the form of orientation adaptation, based on deviations of tactile sensor traces. As a proof of concept of our method, we provide evaluations on an anthropomorphic robot.

AB  - When working alongside human collaborators in dynamic environments such as a disaster recovery, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) may require fast field adaptation to perform its duties or learn novel tasks. In disaster recovery situations, personnel and equipment are constrained, so training must be accomplished with minimal human supervision. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework which uses learned visual perception and inverse optimal control trained with minimal human supervisory examples. This approach is used to learn to mimic navigation behavior and is demonstrated through extensive evaluation in a real-world environment. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to learn an additional behavior with minimal human demonstration in the field.

AB  - The monocular visual-inertial system (VINS), which consists one camera and one low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), is a popular approach to achieve accurate 6-DOF state estimation. However, such locally accurate visual-inertial odometry is prone to drift and cannot provide absolute pose estimation. Leveraging history information to relocalize and correct drift has become a hot topic. In this paper, we propose a monocular visual-inertial SLAM system, which can relocalize camera and get the absolute pose in a previous-built map. Then 4-DOF pose graph optimization is performed to correct drifts and achieve global consistent. The 4-DOF contains x, y, z, and yaw angle, which is the actual drifted direction in the visual-inertial system. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. Current map and previous map can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the accuracy of our system on public datasets and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the map merging ability of our system in the large-scale outdoor environment. The source code of map reuse is integrated into our public code, VINS-Monol11https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono.

AB  - The concept of continuous-time trajectory representation has brought increased accuracy and efficiency to multi-modal sensor fusion in modern SLAM. However, regardless of these advantages, its offline property caused by the requirement of global batch optimization is critically hindering its relevance for real-time and life-long applications. In this paper, we present a dense map-centric SLAM method based on a continuous-time trajectory to cope with this problem. The proposed system locally functions in a similar fashion to conventional Continuous-Time SLAM (CT-SLAM). However, it removes the need for global trajectory optimization by introducing map deformation. The computational complexity of the proposed approach for loop closure does not depend on the operation time, but only on the size of the space it explored before the loop closure. It is therefore more suitable for long term operation compared to the conventional CT-SLAM. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces uncertainty in the reconstructed dense map by using probabilistic surface element (surfel) fusion. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces globally consistent maps without global batch trajectory optimization, and effectively reduces LiDAR noise by surfel fusion.

The new platform is equipped with mechanically separated thrusters, which can take any fuselage posture within a specified range regardless of any direction of translational acceleration. A specially designed servo-linkage mechanism is employed for relative attitude control between the thruster and the fuselage. Mathematical modeling and analysis of the new platform are conducted to explore the control method of the dynamically complex system. For demonstrating the potential of the new T3-multirotor, an autonomous level flight is performed where the fuselage maintains zero roll and pitch angle during the entire flight. Both simulation and experimental results are provided with detailed analysis.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicle. Inspired by prior work in aerobatic post-stall maneuvers for fixed-wing vehicles [1], we explore the feasibility of executing a water-to-air transition with a fixed-wing vehicle using almost entirely commercial off-the-shelf components (excluding the fuselage). To do this, we first propose a conceptual design based on observations about the dominant forces and dimensionless analysis. We then further refine this concept by building a design tool based on simplified models to explore the design space. To verify the results of the design tool, we use a higher fidelity model along with a direct hybrid trajectory optimization approach to show via numerical simulation that the water-to-air transition is feasible. Finally, we successfully test our design experimentally by hand-piloting a prototype vehicle through the water-to-air transition and discuss our approach for replacing the human-pilot with closed-loop control.

AB  - Ground effect refers to the apparent increase in lift that an aircraft experiences when it flies close to the ground. For helicopters, this effect has been modeled since the 1950's based on the work of Cheeseman and Bennett, perhaps the most common method for predicting hover performance due to ground effect. This model, however, is based on assumptions that do not hold for small-scale rotorcraft because it was developed specifically for conventional helicopters. It is not clear if the Cheeseman-Bennett model can be applied to today's multirotor UAVs. In this paper, we compare the Cheeseman-Bennett model to experimental results for rotor performance due to ground effect in several small-scale multirotor and single-rotor configurations. Experimental findings suggest that some of the conventional thinking surrounding helicopter ground effect cannot be applied directly to rotorcraft using fixed propellers at variable speeds (e.g. multirotors), and that it is necessary to adjust the helicopter models to better reflect the differences in such aircraft. The experimental results for multirotors presented are for multiple propeller configurations, speeds and spacings. Ultimately, this work will facilitate the development of an improved UAV flight controller that can accurately account for ground effect to improve flight stability near surfaces and structures.

We first present the design of a large-scale quadcopter that incorporates solar energy harvesting capabilities. Based on the design results, we built the dynamical model of the customized quadcopter with analysis of the aerodynamic influence. A feedback control system is developed for the solar-powered quadcopter that takes into account the wind disturbance and is verified in virtual simulation examples. All parameters used in the modeling and simulations are based on a developed prototype of the solar-powered quadcopter. Flight tests with the prototype are presented to validate the feasibility and theoretical basis of the solar-powered quadcopter.

AB  - Wind power is the source of propulsive energy for sailboats and albatrosses. We present the UNAv, an Unmanned Nautical Air-water vehicle, that borrows features from both. It is composed of a glider-type airframe fitted with a vertical wing-sail extending above the center of mass of the system and a vertical surface-piercing hydrofoil keel extending below. The sail and keel are both actuated in pitch about their span-wise axes. Like an albatross, the UNAv is fully streamlined, high lift-to-drag ratio and generates the gravity-cancelling force by means of its airborne wings. Like a sailboat, the UNAv interacts with water and may access the full magnitude of the wind. A trim analysis predicts that a 3.4-meter span, 3 kg system could stay airborne in winds as low as 2.8 m/s (5.5 knots), and travel several times faster than the wind speed. Trim flight requires the ability to fly at extreme low height with the keel immersed in water. For that purpose, a multi-input longitudinal flight controller that leverages fast flap actuation is presented. The flight maneuver is demonstrated experimentally.

AB  - Many recent works have proposed algorithms for information gathering that benefit from multi-robot cooperation. However, most algorithms either employ discretization of the state and action spaces, which makes them computationally intractable for robotic systems with complex dynamics; or cannot deal with inter-robot restrictions like e.g. communication constraints. This paper presents an approach for multi-robot information gathering that tackles the two aforementioned issues. To this end we propose an algorithm that combines in an innovative manner Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the physical process of interest, RRT planners to plan paths in a continuous domain, and a distributed decision-making algorithm to achieve multi-robot cooperation. Specifically, we employ the Max-sum algorithm for distributed multi-robot cooperation by defining an information-theoretic utility function together with a path clustering approach. This function maximizes information gathering, subject to inter-robot communication constraints. We validate the proposed approach in simulations, and in a field experiment where three quadcopters explore a simulated wind field. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

AB  - Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is a treatment for prostate cancer that involves complete or nerve sparing removal prostate tissue that contains cancer. After removal the bladder neck is successively sutured directly with the urethra. The procedure is called urethrovesical anastomosis and is one of the most dexterity demanding tasks during RALP. Two suturing instruments and a pair of needles are used in combination to perform a running stitch during urethrovesical anastomosis. While robotic instruments provide enhanced dexterity to perform the anastomosis, it is still highly challenging and difficult to learn. In this paper, we presents a vision-guided needle grasping method for automatically grasping the needle that has been inserted into the patient prior to anastomosis. We aim to automatically grasp the suturing needle in a position that avoids hand-offs and immediately enables the start of suturing. The full grasping process can be broken down into: a needle detection algorithm; an approach phase where the surgical tool moves closer to the needle based on visual feedback; and a grasping phase through path planning based on observed surgical practice. Our experimental results show examples of successful autonomous grasping that has the potential to simplify and decrease the operational time in RALP by assisting a small component of urethrovesical anastomosis.

The platform utilizes a hybrid actuation scheme, consisting of a 5 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) servo-actuated manipulator for extra-operative and pivoting motion and a 4 DoF shape memory alloy actuated probe at the distal end, for intra-operative dexterity. The architecture targets thoracic and abdominal operations, with low interaction forces at the probe's end-effector. The system, runs under the Robot Operating System framework for easier deployment and development. Additional accompanying software is developed to aid the surgeon during deployment. Specifically, a Graphical User Interface employing modules controls for online parameter reconfiguration, operation mode switching while custom viewports for stereo imaging are implemented. Teleoperation is feasible with the integration of a haptic device. In-vitro evaluation of the robot is presented, to assess the maneuvering efficiency and further potential exploitation of the design.

The robotic camera design with three extendable wings can reserve sufficient on-board space to harbor the optimized illumination system without affecting the compactness of the camera. We contribute a freeform optical lens design method and develop three miniature optical lenses for the LEDs to achieve greater than 95% illumination uniformity, greater than 14, 000 lx illuminance on a target plane with a distance of 100 mm, and greater than 89% optical efficiency. The prototype is implemented and experimentally tested, which demonstrates great performance of the in-vivo robotic laparoscopic camera and the significance of the optimized illumination system.

AB  - This paper presents a novel magnetic anchored and steered camera robot intended for minimally invasive surgery (MIS), particularly for single port access (SPA) surgery. The design aims to achieve both compactness and a planar pan/tilt workspace (instead of hemispheric) to lower robot footprint in vertical space. Robot comprises two 6mm×6mm diametrically magnetized internal permanent magnets (IPMs) fixed at either ends of a small cylindrical capsule, with camera module and a 45°mirror capped inside capsule. As such, camera view orientation can be steered in 2-DOF across range of 180° tilt and 360° panning, all within a planar workspace close to surface of anchor. Using only two small IPMs for all necessary functions (anchoring, translation along intra-abdominal surface, and steering) reduces bulk and length of robot. The robot is investigated first by finite element methods. Theoretical models for both tilting and panning were then built based on FEM results. The models are evaluated and verified by checking its predictions in benchtop experiments. Ex vivo evaluations was also utilized to prove feasibility of device in environment similar to human anatomy. Overall, the camera robot prototype is compact (4cm length; 7mm diameter), lightweight (3.6g), motor-free, and allow view orientation control (tilting and panning) in a planar workspace. Minimal footprint in vertical space is ideal for many MIS applications, where vertical space is extremely limited.

AB  - We present a real-time vehicle detection and tracking system to accomplish the complex task of driving behavior analysis in urban environments. We propose a robust fusion system that combines a monocular camera and a 2D Lidar. This system takes advantage of three key components: robust vehicle detection using deep learning techniques, high precision range estimation from Lidar, and road context from the prior map knowledge. The camera and Lidar sensor fusion, data association and track management are all performed in the global map coordinate system by taking into account the sensors' characteristics. Lastly, behavior reasoning is performed by examining the tracked vehicle states in the lane coordinate system in which the road context is encoded. We validated our approach by tracking a leading vehicle while it performed usual urban driving behaviors such as lane keeping, stop-and-go at intersections, lane changing, overtaking and turning. The leading vehicle was tracked consistently throughout the 2.3 km route and its behavior was classified reliably.

AB  - Achieving accurate, high-rate pose estimates from proprioceptive and/or exteroceptive measurements is the first step in the development of navigation algorithms for agile mobile robots such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we propose a decoupled Graph-Optimization based Multi-Sensor Fusion approach (GOMSF) that combines generic 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) visual-inertial odometry poses and 3 DoF globally referenced positions to infer the global 6 DoF pose of the robot in real-time. Our approach casts the fusion as a real-time alignment problem between the local base frame of the visual-inertial odometry and the global base frame. The alignment transformation that relates these coordinate systems is continuously updated by optimizing a sliding window pose graph containing the most recent robot's states. We evaluate the presented pose estimation method on both simulated data and large outdoor experiments using a small UAV that is capable to run our system onboard. Results are compared against different state-of-the-art sensor fusion frameworks, revealing that the proposed approach is substantially more accurate than other decoupled fusion strategies. We also demonstrate comparable results in relation with a finely tuned Extended Kalman Filter that fuses visual, inertial and GPS measurements in a coupled way and show that our approach is generic enough to deal with different input sources in a straightforward manner.

AB  - This paper revisits the problem of estimating the attitude, linear velocity and depth of an IMU-Camera with respect to a planar target. The considered solution relies on the measurement of the optical flow (extracted from the continuous homography) complemented with gyrometer and accelerometer measurements. The proposed deterministic observer is accompanied with an observability analysis that points out camera's motion excitation conditions whose satisfaction grants stability of the observer and convergence of the estimation errors to zero. The performance of the observer is illustrated by performing experiments on a testbed IMU-Camera system.

AB  - We present a novel method of measurement covariance estimation that models measurement uncertainty as a function of the measurement itself. Existing work in predictive sensor modeling outperforms conventional fixed models, but requires domain knowledge of the sensors that heavily influences the accuracy and the computational cost of the models. In this work, we introduce Deep Inference for Covariance Estimation (DICE), which utilizes a deep neural network to predict the covariance of a sensor measurement from raw sensor data. We show that given pairs of raw sensor measurement and ground-truth measurement error, we can learn a representation of the measurement model via supervised regression on the prediction performance of the model, eliminating the need for hand-coded features and parametric forms. Our approach is sensor-agnostic, and we demonstrate improved covariance prediction on both simulated and real data.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of inertial sensor placement and noise characteristics on the accuracy of robot pose estimation. Of course, most robots are equipped with joint angle encoders for pose estimation and end-effector positioning. However, in some situations, it's not possible or not desirable to introduce encoders on all joints. Such common examples include legged locomotion, dual arm co-manipulation, and prosthetic limbs. To tackle such situations, one solution is to embed inertial measurement units (IMUs) into artificial skin patches placed on robots' limbs and body. This work analyzes the effects of design parameters such as the number of sensors, their placement on the robot, and noise properties on the quality of robot pose estimation and its signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR). We study the benefits of using a large number of IMUs, which is possible due to the proliferation of inexpensive micro-machined sensors. We use Monte-Carlo simulations and experiments with a two-link robot arm to obtain the distributions of expected estimation error metric values for several accelerometer configurations, which are then compared to determine the optimal number and placement for the IMUs. Results show that the placement of at least two accelerometers on each link has the most significant impact on the pose estimation error, while using a larger number of accelerometers plays a less significant role in reducing the arm pose estimation error and resultant SNR.

AB  - We report system and algorithmic development for a sensing suite comprising multiple sensors for both surface and subsurface transportation infrastructure inspection focusing on multi-modal mapping for inspection. The sensing suite contains a camera, a ground penetrating radar (GPR), and a wheel encoder. We design the sensing suite and propose a data collection scheme using customized artificial landmarks (ALs). We use ALs to synchronize two types data streams: camera images that are temporally evenly-spaced and GPR/encoder data that are spatially evenly-spaced. We also employ pose graph optimization with synchronization as penalty functions to further refine synchronization and perform data fusion for 3D reconstruction. We have implemented the system and tested it in physical experiments. The results show that our system successfully fuses three sensory data and product metric 3D reconstruction. The sensor fusion approach reduces the end-to-end distance error from 7.45cm to 3.10cm.

AB  - An algorithm that uses low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) for estimating link angles for floating base robotic platforms is proposed. Each link has four IMUs attached on its surfaces, and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Complementary Filter (CF) are used for fusing the sensors' data. The algorithm is validated with a commercial mobile working machine, which consist of six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) wheeled base platform, and a 3-DOF hydraulic anthropomorphic arm. Although there are vibrational disturbances from the machine's diesel engine and deformation of the links themselves, the measured results from the planar motion of a floating base hydraulic arm show that the accuracy of the angle estimation is impressively less than 1 degree in the root mean square (RMS) error.

AB  - Endotracheal intubation is one of the most common procedures performed worldwide in emergency departments and operating rooms. It is a highly complicated procedure susceptible to failure. This paper presents a robotic prototype, called IntuBot, designed to automate this procedure. The hardware system consists of a stepper motor to steer the stylet in forward and backward motions and two servo motors to generate bending at the stylet tip to navigate through a patient's airway. A real-time vision-based navigation algorithm is also presented to guide the stylet to localize the vocal cords, which is the tubes ultimate target. For pre-clinical testing, we 3D printed and then molded a silicone model of the airway from the mouth to the vocal cords based on a series of actual CT scan images. The prototype was tested for its steering capabilities.

AB  - In this paper we combine Gaussian process regression and impedance control, to illicit robust, anthropomorphic, adaptive control of a powered ankle prosthesis. We learn the non-linear manifolds which guide how locomotion variables temporally evolve, and regress that surface over a velocity range to create a manifold. The joint set of manifolds, as well as the temporal evolution of the gait-cycle duration is what we term a locomotion envelope. Current powered prostheses have problems adapting across speeds. It is likely that humans rely upon a control strategy which is adaptable, can become more robust and accurate with more data and provides a nonparametric approach which allows the strategy to grow with the number of observations. We demonstrate such a strategy in this study and successfully simulate locomotion well beyond our training data. The method we propose is based on common physical features observed in numerous human subjects walking at different speeds. Based on the derived locomotion envelopes we show that ankle power increases monotonically with speed among all subjects. We demonstrate our methods in simulation and human experiments, on a powered ankle foot prosthesis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

AB  - The exploration of an “intelligent” orthotic shoe sole to negate, or minimize, longitudinal slip by momentarily increasing friction force is presented. The conceptual device takes the form of a rubberized shoe sole containing pockets of air that can be released via valves controlled by a microprocessor. During a slip event, the valves would be opened and the bladders would be collapsed by the weight of the user, which modulates contact and friction forces. The goal is to increase friction forces in this process, by creating an impact force between the user and ground surface, with the potential to increase friction and mitigate slip. Simulations of bladder walls, air flow through valves, contact forces, and friction forces are modeled and combined into a lumped parameter model to predict device behavior. Prototypes of the device are created and evaluated to validate models and slip-mitigating potential.

The developed device consists of two units, a nerve holder and an electrode inserter. We introduce design considerations, features, and underlying mechanisms of the device. User tests and animal experiments show that users can easily and accurately adjust the insertion position and direction of nerve electrodes while manipulating the device in 3D, and that planar electrodes are successfully inserted into sciatic nerves of rats. We hope that the proposed device will help neural engineering researchers and scientists to simplify the surgical process and produce consistent experimental results.

AB  - Gastric ulcer is a chronic and complex (and often complete) erosion of the stomach wall that happens as a complication of a previous chronic, inflammatory process. It represents a catastrophic situation in which the patient is critical and its conditions need to be treated fast. This study presents a remotely navigatable and deployable ingestible patch and plug for gastric ulcer treatment. The patch/plug structure is made of agarose hydrogel that can change rigidity through hydration and dehydration. When dehydrated, it is rigid and can maintain a folded configuration so it can be ingested as a “pill”. This can be guided to the targeted location by a magnetic field, and be deployed instantly by hydration, namely by supplying water from the mouth. Due to the deployable origami design, it exhibits an expansion of 10 times its initial surface area, making the device suitable for the use of dressing a surface as a patch, and filling a hole as a plug.

AB  - The use ofrobotic devices for drug delivery in sensitive area of the human body is an innovative and reliable solution. Most of them use magnetics fields, to steer micro-nano-robots into diseases locations. In this study, we use a magnetic actuator based on two permanent magnets as an end-effector of a robotic manipulator. The actuator offers the possibility to generate both pushing and pulling forces on the magnetic actuator axis in an open-loop control way. We describe in this paper the robotic drug delivery strategy that we implemented in a 6 degree of freedom robotic manipulator to push and to steer a magnetic microparticle from the round window to the apex of the human cochlea. Different experiments have been conducted in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the navigation proposed strategy on a human phantom cochlea. The results demonstrate clearly that precise and reliable drug administration is rendered possible.

We have developed a wearable soft robotic sleeve that uses fiber reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) to provide actuation and stiffness at the elbow for augmented lifting and carrying ability. The sleeve includes novel linear and helical actuator architectures to induce and resist joint movement respectively, and is intended to be comfortable, lightweight, and low profile. We developed test protocols to measure actuation and stiffness performance of different helical and linear architectures, and to compare helical and linear actuator groups when used individually and together. Our findings indicate that nested linear actuators have superior contraction ratios compared to parallel linear actuators, resulting in greater angular displacement. Stiffness from helical actuators increased with pressure and number of parallel actuators. A combined linear-helical actuator configuration considerably outperformed helical and linear actuator groups when used on their own.

AB  - We present a pneumatic actuator capable of changing length by 1000%, applying both pushing and pulling forces, and independently modulating its length and stiffness. These characteristics are enabled by individually addressable internal and external chambers that work antagonistically against one another. The high deformation with low hysteresis is achieved by wrinkling of thin materials that are assumed to be inextensible but flexible, as opposed to stretchable. A model for the actuator is presented and validated with experimental results, showing capabilities of high strain, pushing and pulling, and independent control of length and stiffness. These characteristics are motivated by the application of a compliant truss robot. Accordingly, we show a simple grounded tetrahedron with three actuator elements and three static elements. We demonstrate motion of the tetrahedron apex against external loads and the ability of the structure to vary its stiffness. The actuator offers a unique set of characteristics that could increase the capabilities of soft robotic devices.

AB  - Soft robotic actuators are highly elastic bodies that oscillate drastically once excited. This oscillation is undesirable in many applications. So far, very little studies on soft actuator damping have been reported. In this paper, we report a simple and effective vibration damping method based on passive and active particle damping. Experimental studies on the effectiveness of particle damping have been conducted. It is found that active particle damping is more effective than passive damping, nevertheless, active particle damping demands a more complicated design with extra energy source and control. Since particles are discrete matters, they can be seamless integrated into soft actuator design with only minor influence of soft actuator's compliance and softness.

AB  - This work presents a novel variable stiffness structure consisting of a fiber-constrained dielectric elastomer tube filled with insulating oil. The tensile stiffness of the structure can be adjusted by voltages and its initial value can be customized according to the initial pre-stretch of the material. The structure has a dimension of ~30 mm diameter × 50 mm length. A mathematical analysis is established to predict the initial tensile stiffness of the structure. The changes of the tensile stiffness of the structure under voltages are verified experimentally. The results show a decrease of the tensile stiffness of the device by 25% at 4 kV and the decrement is also related to the elongation of the structure. With different pre-stretches and dimensions of the dielectric elastomer, one can obtain devices with different variation ranges of tensile stiffness.

AB  - Jamming of granular media has been shown to possess the property of stiffness variation, transitioning from a soft to a quasi-solid state depending on the packing density of the granules. Recently, a gradual stiffness change for bending has been reported by using compliant, cubic shaped granules. Here we demonstrate that the same method and material also exhibits a gradual stiffness change for compression. As a potential application of “compliant jamming”, a bio-inspired robotic platform with jamming membranes as end effectors is designed and tasked with climbing straight vertical shafts. First, the benefit of varying the bending stiffness is investigated in the climbing task by measuring the friction force that the end effectors are applying to the shaft walls, especially if the walls are irregularly shaped. Then the role of compressive stiffness variation is explored by analyzing the performance of the robot in the climbing task, showing multi-modal properties of jamming membranes: (i) enabling a pressure sensor to detect the shaft walls, acting (ii) as grippers that actively use the irregularities of the walls to climb up by state-switching the granular material and (iii) as force dissipators that can dissipate internal forces caused by closed kinematic chains.

AB  - In this paper, a geometric and unified model of soft-rigid multi-body systems is presented, based on a discrete Cosserat approach of the soft-body dynamics. The model is in fact a generalization to soft and hybrid systems of the geometric theory of rigid robotics characterized by the exponential map. A generalization of the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm is also presented, able to solve inverse and forward dynamic problems with linear O(N) complexity. The proposed model provides several improvements with respect to the existing flexible multi-body models, which make it particularly suitable to study the dynamics of modern soft robots as shown for a multi-body system inspired by motile bacteria.

AB  - Morphological computation is a concept relevant to robots made of soft and elastic materials. It states that robot's rich dynamics can be exploited to generate desirable behaviors, which can be altered when their morphology is adapted accordingly. This paper presents a low-cost robot made of elastic curved beam driven by a motor, with morphological computation and adaptation ability. Simply by changing robot's shape and the rotating frequency of the motor that vibrates the robot's body, the robot is able to shift its behavior from showing a tendency to slide when it needs to perform tasks like going under confined space, to have more tendency to hop diagonally forward when the robot stands upright. It will also be shown that based on the proposed mechanism, the energy efficiency of the robot locomotion can be maximized.

This paper advances this trend by creating soft robots modeling the complex motion patterns of octopus tentacles employing a bio-mimetic approach. The proposed octopus robot is entirely made from soft material and uses a novel fluidic actuation mechanism that allows the robot to advance forward, change directions and rotate around its primary axis. The paper presents the robot's design and fabrication process. An experimental study is conducted showing the feasibility of the proposed robot and actuation mechanism.

AB  - This paper analyzes the completion time of automated manufacturing systems, especially a dual-armed cluster tool, equipped with parallel processing modules (PMs). Cluster tools, which consist of multiple PMs, a transport robot, and loadlocks where wafer lots are loaded and unloaded, perform semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as lithography, etching, deposition, and testing. Wafer lots are transported by overhead hoist transports (OHTs) between tools or stockers where wafer lots are stored. To reduce the idle time of OHTs or cluster tools, it is essential to estimate the time when all wafers of a lot finish processing in a tool. Hence, we derive closed-form expressions for the completion time of wafer lots, especially in dual-armed cluster tools with parallel PMs to reflect real circumstances of fabs. We finally show that the formulas derived can be used even when there are small processing time variations with numerical experiments.

AB  - A crucial challenge in robotics is achieving reliable results in spite of sensing and control uncertainty. In this work, we explore the conformant planning approach to robot manipulation. In particular, we tackle the problem of pushing multiple planar objects simultaneously to achieve a specified arrangement without external sensing. Conformant planning is a belief-state planning problem. A belief state is the set of all possible states of the world, and the goal is to find a sequence of actions that will bring an initial belief state to a goal belief state. To do forward belief-state planning, we created a deterministic belief-state transition model from supervised learning based on off-line physics simulations. We compare our method with an on-line physics-based manipulation approach and show significantly reduced planning times and increased robustness in simulated experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the success of this approach in simulations and physical robot experiments.

AB  - In many industrial robotics applications, such as spot-welding, spray-painting or drilling, the robot is required to visit successively multiple targets. The robot travel time among the targets is a significant component of the overall execution time. This travel time is in turn greatly affected by the order of visit of the targets, and by the robot configurations used to reach each target. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize these two elements, a problem known in the literature as the Robotic Task Sequencing Problem (RTSP). Our contribution in this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a fast, near-optimal, algorithm to solve RTSP. The key to our approach is to exploit the classical distinction between task space and configuration space, which, surprisingly, has been so far overlooked in the RTSP literature. Second, we provide an open-source implementation of the above algorithm, which has been carefully benchmarked to yield an efficient, ready-to-use, software solution. We discuss the relationship between RTSP and other Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variants, such as the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP), and show experimentally that our method finds motion sequences of the same quality but using several orders of magnitude less computation time than existing approaches.

AB  - In this paper, we are concerned with the automation of single robot exogeneous assembly in simple planar settings. Here, a set of of unactuated disk-shaped parts needs to be serviced by a single robot that resides outside the workspace and is capable of moving the parts one at a time through sliding or lifting slightly. The task is to have the parts end up in their respective goal positions without any collisions whilst moving. We present an automated reactive approach through the composition of one-part movements. The movement of each part is achieved by a controller obtained through the projection of a carefully constructed vector field on the respective configuration subspace. Such a scheme is known to accommodate positional variations naturally. Once the movement terminates, the robot chooses the next part to move in a cyclic manner. The contribution of this paper is to show for the first time that with certain restrictions on the allowed goal configurations, the assembly task is either successfully completed or terminated (rather than useless cycling of a part or from part to part) while the generated sequence of motions never causes collisions among the parts.

We represent this problem as heuristic search with a set of primitive dirt-oriented tool actions. We present dirt and action representations that allow efficient learning and prediction of future dirt states, given the current dirt state and applied action. We also present a method for sampling promising actions based on a clustering of dirt states and heuristics for planning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging cleaning tasks through implementations on PR2 and Fetch robots.

AB  - In this paper, we consider reorienting 3D objects on a table using a two-finger pinch gripper. Given the 3D mesh model of the object, our algorithm solves for the gripper motions that are required to transit between arbitrary object poses, grasping positions and gripper poses. The two motion primitives we used, pivoting and compliant rolling, enable us to decompose the planning problem and solve it more efficiently. Our algorithm can work with approximated (simplified) mesh models while being robust to approximation errors, thereby allowing us to efficiently handle object shapes with originally thousands of facets. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by testing on objects with non-trivial geometry in both simulations and experiments. Results show that our algorithm can solve a larger range of reorienting problems with less number of making and breaking contacts when compared to traditional pick-and-place based methods, especially when the gripper workspace is highly constrained.

AB  - The control problem in self-adjustable treadmills is to keep the position of the user at a reference position. The position error is the key obstacle in facilitating the abrupt stopping on self-adjustable treadmills. Another difficulty in this application is the oscillatory response of the closed-loop system. The conventional control methods utilize a high-gain observer to estimate the user velocity and exploit this information beside feedback signals to decrease the position error. Utilizing the high-gain observer, however, applies anomalous force (AF) to the user, leading to an unnatural feeling, and does not guarantee an oscillation-free response for the output. This paper aims to alleviate these problems by proposing a supervisory control scheme. First, a RISE controller is utilized for walking/running stage to compensate for slowly varying uncertainties in the system model without applying a large AF. Then, a positive-output controller is exploited for the stopping stage to guarantee the convergence of the position error without oscillation. Using the estimated intentional velocity and acceleration, a supervisory system is designed to switch between the controllers. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach over the existing methods.

AB  - This paper describes the dynamic modeling and locomotion control of a two-link underactuated brachiating robot traversing a flexible cable. A multi-body system comprised of a two-link robot, a flexible cable, and coupling soft junctions is modeled dynamically. This model is used to formulate an energy-minimizing optimal control strategy that includes the effects of cable vibration induced by robot locomotion. Optimized trajectories and control torque profiles are obtained via multiple-shooting and parametric trajectory approaches. Simulation results show that these optimal torque profiles result in energy-efficient continuous brachiation over a flexible cable. Additional studies examine how the optimal torque profiles change depending on the robot's initial position along a catenary cable.

AB  - Robot-based sensitive assembly is a recent and growing trend in robotics. Force-controlled robots are expected to interact with an unknown environment using solely force feedback information. In general, the exact contact is difficult to predict due to various impact factors, such as the dynamics of the interaction, work-piece stiffness and geometry, the robot's configuration, and the efficiency of the control algorithm. Currently, there is no general indicator for evaluating the performance of a force-controlled robot. This work presents a concept of such a performance indicator. In order to test the proposed concept for comparison, an experimental setup is presented that simulates a contour-following task under force control. This setup is used to test two robots with different force-controllers and control principles, namely direct force and impedance control. The results indicate good applicability of the proposed performance indicator to benchmark force-controlled robots, and this is extensively discussed.

AB  - Robot malfunction is inevitable in practical applications of the robot formation control due to uncontrolled crashing, system malfunction or communication loss. In this paper, we study the synchronous formation control problem in the presence of robot malfunctions. Our main idea is to improve the network connectivity and motion synchronism of the robot formation through a series of topology switchings and robot replacements. Firstly, the synchronous formation control method is introduced which enables the robots to tracking their desired trajectories while keeping predefined formation shapes. Secondly, a recursive switched topology control strategy is proposed to restore the formation shape as well as to improve the network connectivity and motion synchronism in the presence of robot malfunctions. Thirdly, the convergence analysis of the proposed control system is presented and a sufficient condition is obtained under an average dwell time scheme. What's more, the proposed approach is fully distributed and the communication delays between neighboring robots also have been taken into consideration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Typical robot force control architectures have a positive force feedback loop to decouple robot dynamics from contact dynamics. Due to the noisy profile of force measurements, it is common to filter force signals by low pass filters. This paper shows that, when force feedback is filtered, robot and environment dynamics are no longer decoupled, affecting force control performance. Additionally, the perceived stiffness from the force control perspective, is correlated with the robot effective mass. To cope with this issue, a force based stiffness estimation strategy that also includes the inertial properties (effective mass) in the estimation algorithm is proposed, allowing to adapt control gains based on the robot effective mass. In this way, the perceived stiffness can be seen as a control optimization parameter, rather than a well defined physical property. Simulation and experimental results with a 1-DoF robot and 7-DoF manipulator, respectively, validate the estimation strategy, showing better force control results with the perceived stiffness in the control loop, as compared to the real environment stiffness.

AB  - Grasping a moving target has been investigated extensively for fixed-base manipulator. However, such a task becomes much more challenging when the manipulator is free flying in the air with an UAV. Towards moving target grasping, this paper presents an aerial manipulator system composed of a hex-rotor and a 7-DoF (Degree of Freedom) manipulator. An independent control structure is used in the aerial manipulator control system, i.e., the hex-rotor and the manipulator are controlled separately. In the hex-rotor's controller, the system CoM (Center of Mass) offset motion is used to compensate disturbance of the robotic arm. In the manipulator's controller, the relative kinematics between the target and the aerial vehicle is taken into consideration to grasp the target. At last aerial grasping experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme and the reliability of our aerial manipulator system.

AB  - In autonomous robotics there are many situations that require solving a motion planning problem to complete a task. A Task Space (T-Space), composed of parameters that define the task being performed, can be a more effective planning space for these problems, however, planning within a T-Space is often computationally challenging. In this paper, we present a novel method to analyse the relationship between T-Space parameters and the pose of manipulator bodies to create a dependency matrix. We then use this information to decompose the motion planning problem into sequential lower complexity sub-problems. We call this approach Task Space Motion Planning Decomposition (TSMPD). This paper introduces TSMPD and quantifies the improvement to planning efficiency on a challenging maze navigation problem and weld path planning problem.

AB  - Navigating in search and rescue environments is challenging, since a variety of terrains has to be considered. Hybrid driving-stepping locomotion, as provided by our robot Momaro, is a promising approach. Similar to other locomotion methods, it incorporates many degrees of freedom - offering high flexibility but making planning computationally expensive for larger environments. We propose a navigation planning method, which unifies different levels of representation in a single planner. In the vicinity of the robot, it provides plans with a fine resolution and a high robot state dimensionality. With increasing distance from the robot, plans become coarser and the robot state dimensionality decreases. We compensate this loss of information by enriching coarser representations with additional semantics. Experiments show that the proposed planner provides plans for large, challenging scenarios in feasible time.

AB  - This paper describes skating locomotion for a quadruped robot with dexterous limbs. The emphasis is on design of omnidirectional motion primitives and quantification of resulting speed and accuracy when traversing different types of smooth but potentially non-flat terrain. In particular, we study trade-offs between using four-wheeled versus three-wheeled skating maneuvers. In four-wheeled skating, motions have the benefit of symmetry, so that errors due to wheel slip should theoretically cancel out on average. Three-wheeled skating, by contrast, introduces significantly more asymmetry in configuration and contact force distribution over time; however, it has the advantage of guaranteeing continuous ground contact for all skates when terrain has bumps or other curvature. We present simulation results quantifying errors for each approach, for various terrains. Our results allow us to tune motions to reduce biases and variability in motion, which are primarily due to accelerations as locomotion begins.

AB  - Planning smooth trajectories is important for the safe, efficient and comfortable operation of mobile robots, such as wheeled robots moving in crowded environments or cars moving at high speed. Asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planners can be used to generate such trajectories. However, to achieve the necessary efficiency for the realtime operation of robots, one often uses their initial feasible trajectories or the trajectories of non-optimal motion planners instead, typically after a post-smoothing step. We propose a gradient-informed post-smoothing algorithm, called GRIPS, that deforms given trajectories by locally optimizing the placement of vertices while satisfying the system's kinodynamic constraints. We show experimentally that GRIPS typically produces trajectories of significantly smaller length and higher smoothness than several existing post-smoothing algorithms.

Applications are, amongst many others, mobile cleaning robots, lawn mowing robots or harvesting machines in agriculture. Many approaches and facets of this problem have been discussed in literature but despite the availability of several surveys on the topic there is little work on quantitative assessment and comparison of different coverage path planning algorithms. This paper analyzes six popular off-line coverage path planning methods, applicable to previously recorded maps, in the setting of indoor coverage path planning on room-sized units. The implemented algorithms are thoroughly compared on a large dataset of over 550 rooms with and without furniture.

AB  - Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) constitute an intuitive tool for designing autonomous robot navigation control schemes, though they generally suffer from the existence of local minima which may trap the robot away from its desired configuration, an issue usually addressed by appropriate offline “tuning” of the potential field's parameters. On the other side, most APF based approaches rely on a diffeomorphism to sphere worlds to handle realistic scenarios, which may be either costly to compute (e.g., conformal mappings) or requires some sort of preconditioning of the workspace (e.g., decomposition of complex geometries to simple elementary components). In this work, we first propose a constructive procedure to map multiply connected compact 2D workspaces to one or more punctured disks based on harmonic maps. Subsequently, we design an APF based control scheme along with an adaptive law for its parameters that requires no offline tuning to guarantee safe convergence to its goal configuration. Finally, an extensive simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control scheme.

AB  - In Multi-Policy Decision-Making (MPDM), many computationally-expensive forward simulations are performed in order to predict the performance of a set of candidate policies. In risk-aware formulations of MPDM, only the worst outcomes affect the decision making process, and efficiently finding these influential outcomes becomes the core challenge. Recently, stochastic gradient optimization algorithms, using a heuristic function, were shown to be significantly superior to random sampling. In this paper, we show that accurate gradients can be computed - even through a complex forward simulation - using approaches similar to those in deep networks. We show that our proposed approach finds influential outcomes more reliably, and is faster than earlier methods, allowing us to evaluate more policies while simultaneously eliminating the need to design an easily-differentiable heuristic function. We demonstrate significant performance improvements in simulation as well as on a real robot platform navigating a highly dynamic environment.

AB  - One of the main challenges of bipedal gait is to avoid falling due to unknown disturbances. Compensating for these disturbances in bipeds is often achieved by leaning or stepping. In this work, the Spherical Foot Placement Estimator (SFPE) is introduced, which uses the biped's current kinematics and dynamics to predict if a step is needed, and if so where to step, to restore balance in 3D. An example of a controller using the SFPE is shown, which augments an existing optimal controller with both leaning and stepping: SFPE-based feedback is used to generate a desired momentum for momentum-based leaning while the SFPE point is used as a control reference for stepping. The new estimator outperforms existing balance criteria by providing both recovery step location prediction and momentum objectives with smooth dynamics.

AB  - Real-time planning of footsteps has been a big challenge for bipedal research. A large number of methods have been proposed over the last several years. In addition, divergent component of motion (DCM) of linear inverted pendulum (LIP) has been applied to solve this problem thus attracting a great deal of attention. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution of DCM for an arbitrary input function and propose a novel quadratic programming (QP) problem for the simultaneous optimization of zero moment point (ZMP) and foot placements based on the analytical solution. To validate the method, we conducted a push recovery experiment on real hardware. The result of the experiment shows that our new algorithm realizes a hierarchical strategy for disturbance compensation.

AB  - Robotics controllers often consist of expert-designed heuristics, which can be hard to tune in higher dimensions. Simulation can aid in optimizing these controllers if parameters learned in simulation transfer to hardware. Unfortunately, this is often not the case in legged locomotion, necessitating learning directly on hardware. This motivates using data-efficient learning techniques like Bayesian Optimization (BO) to minimize collecting expensive data samples. BO is a black-box data-efficient optimization scheme, though its performance typically degrades in higher dimensions. We aim to overcome this problem by incorporating domain knowledge, with a focus on bipedal locomotion. In our previous work, we proposed a feature transformation that projected a 16-dimensional locomotion controller to a 1-dimensional space using knowledge of human walking. When optimizing a human-inspired neuromuscular controller in simulation, this feature transformation enhanced sample efficiency of BO over traditional BO with a Squared Exponential kernel. In this paper, we present a generalized feature transform applicable to non-humanoid robot morphologies and evaluate it on the ATRIAS bipedal robot, in both simulation and hardware. We present three different walking controllers and two are evaluated on the real robot. Our results show that this feature transform captures important aspects of walking and accelerates learning on hardware and simulation, as compared to traditional BO.

AB  - Developments for 3D control of the center of mass (CoM) of biped robots are currently located in two local minima: on the one hand, methods that allow CoM height variations but only work in the 2D sagittal plane; on the other hand, nonconvex direct transcriptions of centroidal dynamics that are delicate to handle. This paper presents an alternative that controls the CoM in 3D via an indirect transcription that is both low-dimensional and solvable fast enough for real-time control. The key to this development is the notion of boundedness condition, which quantifies the capturability of 3D CoM trajectories.

AB  - In this work, we present an extension to a linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that plans external contact forces for the robot when given multiple contact locations and their corresponding friction cone. To this end, we set up a two-step optimization problem. In the first optimization, we compute the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory, foot step locations, and introduce slack variables to account for violating the imposed constraints on the Zero Moment Point (ZMP). We then use the slack variables to trigger the second optimization, in which we calculate the optimal external force that compensates for the ZMP tracking error. This optimization considers multiple contacts positions within the environment by formulating the problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) that can be solved at a speed between 100-300 Hz. Once contact is created, the MIQP reduces to a single Quadratic Program (QP) that can be solved in real-time (<; 1kHz). Simulations show that the presented walking control scheme can withstand disturbances 2-3× larger with the additional force provided by a hand contact.

AB  - When walking at high speeds, the swing legs of robots produce a non-negligible angular momentum rate. To accommodate this, we provide a reference trajectory generator for bipedal walking that incorporates predicted centroidal angular momentum at the planning stage. This can be done efficiently as the Centroidal Moment Pivot (CMP), Instantaneous Capture Point (ICP) and the center of mass (CoM) all have closed-form trajectory solutions due to their linear dynamics. This is then used to produce smooth, continuous trajectories. We furthermore provide a lightweight model to estimate angular momentum as induced during leg swing of the gait cycle. Our proposed trajectory generator is tested thoroughly in simulation and has been shown to successfully operate on the real hardware.

AB  - Active lower limb prosthetics rely on the detection of gait mode to direct controller response. The majority of systems require feedback from the prosthetic and/or inertial measurement units (IMUs). Reliance on movement delays classification, reducing the range of patient activities and terrain traversed. Neuromuscular interfaces using electromyography (EMG) enable real-time monitoring by registering user intent, however EMG has known robustness issues out-of-clinic that have impeded its translation. Furthermore, supervised training of gait classifiers can require large subject-specific amputee data sets which are difficult to obtain. Mechanomyography (MMG) has shown less dependence on environmental conditions than EMG yet has seen limited use in this realm. In this investigation we introduce an MMG gait classifier targeting improved control of prosthetic (robotic) legs. We compare the accuracy of subject specific classifiers to those trained using subject-independent pooling. Additionally, we quantify the effect of introducing a small amount of data from individual test subjects to the training pool. Experiments were performed on 12 participants and 5 gait modes. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieved 65% accuracy with subject-specific data, 92% with pooled training data, and 94% with pooled plus limited user-specific data. The results show the promise of MMG gait classifiers with increased robustness and reduced subject-specific training in prosthetic control.

AB  - The low-cost manufacturing and maintenance of prostheses is of vital importance to their successful deployment in developing countries. Low-cost prosthesis actuation is generally achieved by combining pre-programmed control strategies, with surface-electromyographic measurements taken from the residual limb. In a standard setting, these signals are measured with disposable gel electrodes. However, this limit on electrode reuse requires that prosthesis users have a stable supply of electrodes. Alternatively, the textile electrodes sewn from conductive thread are studied in the context of hand gesture recognition to consider their future use with low-cost prostheses. In this paper, it is demonstrated that textile electrodes can be applied for gesture recognition. To do so, surface electromyography (sEMG) experiments are run in South Africa on three amputees where they were asked to perform gestures with their phantom limb (i.e., the missing limb segment). A gesture recognition method is implemented, and the classification accuracy with data recorded from textile electrodes is compared to that from gel electrodes. Further analysis examining the relationship between classifier performance and physiological parameters are performed. Results show that textile electrodes can be used to perform accurate gesture recognition, and are comparable to disposable gel electrodes. This demonstrates that low-cost sensory systems are not barrier to myoelectric control in developing countries.

AB  - Continuous, easy-to-implement, accurate inference of intended joint angles is important for effectively controlling powered prosthetic devices that can improve the lives and capabilities of upper-limb amputees. Estimation of intended joint angles is difficult because conventional biosignals are not directly related to the intended angle motion. In previous work, we began to address this issue by confirming that both transra-dial amputees and intact subjects, the measured deformation of the muscle bulge on the skin surface change according to the intended wrist joint angle. This paper presents a continuous prosthesis wrist joint control method using this deformation signal. We here verify the effectiveness of the distribution of the muscle bulge for accurate and stable wrist joint angle control in real time. The wrist joint angles were calculated in real time from a muscle viscoelastic model using the previously determined algorithm. We compared the error between measured and estimated angles with a conventional method, the Voigt model, and the KelvinVoigt model. Experimental results obtained for three intact people over three trials of wrist movement tasks gave the accuracy and stability of 7.96±6.16° when using the Voigt model; this is a similar performance compared to related work using a surface electromyogram. A method for continuously controlling the wrist joint angle for a prosthesis using the distribution of the muscle bulge was thus successfully established.

AB  - Surface electromyography is currently the sensing modality of choice for control of biosignal-driven prostheses and exoskeletons; however, the sensor's noisy and aggregate nature inhibits collection of distinguishable signal streams to robustly manipulate multiple device degrees of freedom (DoF). We here explore 2D B-mode ultrasound as an alternative source of muscle activation data (namely, muscle deformation) that can be more precisely localized, allowing for the theoretical collection of multiple naturally-varying signals that could be used to control high-DoF assistive devices. We here present a proof-of-concept study showing a) the observability of muscle deformation via ultrasound, and b) novel descriptions of the spatially-varying nature of the signal. These analyses are accomplished through the study of nine volumetric scans of the biceps brachii under varied elbow angle and loading conditions, collected and spatially localized using an ultrasound scanner and motion capture. We here establish the feasibility of measuring several force-associated deformation signals (including muscle cross-sectional area and thickness) via real-time ultrasound scanning and quantify the spatial variation of these signals. Additionally, we propose future applications for both our signal characterizations and the generated muscle volume data set, including better design of assistive device sensor locations and validation of existing muscle deformation models.

AB  - Using a rehabilitation robot to activate motion intention and reflex response simultaneously is an effective approach to aiding recovery from paralysis caused by neurological disorders. Mechanical motions supported by conventional robots are, however, not enough to activate reflex. In this paper, we propose a grasp-training robot that can stimulate the grasp reflex of a paralyzed hand by pushing the hand onto an elastic bar while supporting the grasping movements. In addition to this feature, we discuss the robot design in relation to its usability and wearability for ease of use in clinical practice. Experimental results obtained from healthy subjects show that the proposed robot can support grasping in a way similar to the traditional range-of-motion exercise used by therapists for grasp rehabilitation. Combining this appropriate grasping-motion support and the mechanism for pushing the hand onto an elastic bar succeeds in activating the grasp reflex of a completely paralyzed patient in a clinical test that involves monitoring electromyography signals from the paralyzed hand.

AB  - Applications that provide location related services need to understand the environment in which humans live such that verbal references and human interaction are possible. We formulate this semantic labelling task as the problem of learning the semantic labels from the perceived 3D structure. In this contribution we propose a batch approach and a novel multi-view frame fusion technique to exploit multiple views for improving the semantic labelling results. The batch approach works offline and is the direct application of an existing single-view method to scene reconstructions with multiple views. The multi-view frame fusion works in an incremental fashion accumulating the single-view results, hence allowing the online multi-view semantic segmentation of single frames and the offline reconstruction of semantic maps. Our experiments show the superiority of the approaches based on our fusion scheme, which leads to a more accurate semantic labelling.

AB  - This paper presents a weakly-supervised learning system for real-time road marking detection using images of complex urban environments obtained from a monocular camera. We avoid expensive manual labelling by exploiting additional sensor modalities to generate large quantities of annotated images in a weakly-supervised way, which are then used to train a deep semantic segmentation network. At run time, the road markings in the scene are detected in real time in a variety of traffic situations and under different lighting and weather conditions without relying on any preprocessing steps or predefined models. We achieve reliable qualitative performance on the Oxford RobotCar dataset, and demonstrate quantitatively on the CamVid dataset that exploiting these annotations significantly reduces the required labelling effort and improves performance.

AB  - We present an approach to automatically assign semantic labels to rooms reconstructed from 3D RGB maps of apartments. Evidence for the room types is generated using state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques for scene classification and object detection based on automatically generated virtual RGB views, as well as from a geometric analysis of the map's 3D structure. The evidence is merged in a conditional random field, using statistics mined from different datasets of indoor environments. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively and compare it to related methods.
