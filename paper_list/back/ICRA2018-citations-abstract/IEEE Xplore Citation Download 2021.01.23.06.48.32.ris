AB  - This year a record number of papers were submitted directly to ICRA (1981) and to RA-L with the ICRA option (605). This represents an increase of 4% and 48% over last year respectively - clearly the RA-L/ICRA option is growing in popularity. The long-term average is a growth rate of around 60 papers per year. The submission process accommodated, as much as possible, the hardships inflicted on authors by hurricanes and earthquakes in the days prior to the deadline.

AB  - In this paper, an automatic planner for minimally invasive neurosurgery is presented. The solution provides the neurosurgeon with the best path to connect a user-defined entry point with a target in accordance with a specific cost function. The approach guarantees the avoidance of obstacles which can be found along the insertion pathway. The method is tailored to the EDEN2020* programmable bevel-tip needle, a multisegment steerable probe intended to be used to perform drug delivery for the treatment of glioblastomas. A sample-based heuristic search inspired by the BIT* algorithm is used to define the asymptotically-optimal solution in terms of path length, followed by a smoothing phase to meet the required kinematic constraints of the needle. To account for inaccuracies in catheter modeling, which could determine unexpected control errors over the insertion procedure, an uncertainty margin is defined in order to increase the algorithm's safety. The feasibility of the proposed solution was demonstrated by testing the method in simulated neurosurgical scenarios with different degrees of obstacle occupancy and against other sample-based algorithms present in literature: RRT, RRT* and an enhanced version of the RRT-Connect.

AB  - Bronchoscopic intervention, as a minimally invasive method for the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases, has attracted more and more attention in recent years. However, existing endobronchial instruments lack the steerability accessing the peripheral airways with difficult bifurcations. This paper presents a novel wire-driven dexterous manipulator for the guidance of such instruments. Precision laser profiling is used to cut a stainless steel tube into multiple interlocked segments with revolute joints. The outer diameter of the manipulator is 2.20 mm which is small enough to be inserted into the working channels of most commercial bronchoscopes and distal airways, while keeping a large inner lumen with a diameter of 1.44 mm for passing various bronchoscopic instruments. The small bending radius provides enough flexibility to navigate inside the complex bronchial tree. Two kinematic models are proposed to predict the manipulator configuration from the translation of actuation wires. The former model is geometrically derived with the assumption of constant curvature bending and the latter one is statistically driven by capturing the motion trajectories of manipulator joints. A prototype of our low-cost add-on instrument guidance robot for bronchoscopic intervention is presented which can be easily integrated into current clinical routine.

AB  - In most cases of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the operating surgeon must use a variety of catheters riding on a thin wire known as a `guidewire'. This guidewire must be manually navigated through a tortuous pathway of arteries to arrive at the diseased area. Automation of the guidewire therefore reduces surgeon effort and minimizes the time required for a PAD procedure, but is restricted by the size constraints of a standard guidewire. This work presents the design of a robotically actuated 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF) guidewire tip comprised of joints laser micro-machined into a 0.78 mm (<; 2.4 Fr) Nitinol tube. We present an analysis of the notch joint used as a building block in the robot and a control strategy for this type of a joint. The experimental results show that tendon force is an important observable quantity that can be used as a shape sensing mechanism for this type of a joint in practical control applications.

AB  - This paper discusses the design method of a self-propelled catheter with thin diameter of 2.6mm, aimed for moving and steering in the bronchi. As the basic configuration, the proposed catheter is composed of an inner tube and McKibben artificial muscles. It can propel by generating travelling waves by a single supply line driven by pneumatics. Since the inner tube equips with orifices of different size, several McKibben chambers can deform with the time delay. We also propose the method to steer the direction at the branch pipe, whose angle can be adjusted by PWM control of pressuring. Besides, we also introduce the design method of how to deal with the pipes with different diameters. The validity of these proposed methods are verified by the prototype through the experiments in the bronchial model.

AB  - Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive approach for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment. Compared to open surgery, the benefits of EVAR include faster recovery and shorter time in hospital as well as no general anesthesia (in most cases). Though EVAR has become a preferred way to treat AAA with an increasing number of procedures, there are persisting complications, e.g. stent graft migration. Suturing the stent graft to the aorta increases the displacement force necessary to move the implant. This paper describes the design of a suturing catheter for EVAR. The suturing device consist of two modules which can be inserted through the femoral arteries into the abdominal aorta where both join using an electro-magnetic connector. The positioning module provides an anchor inside the aorta for the suturing module and new sequential positions for each stitch. Our large-scale prototype is validated inside a phantom vessel made of silicone material. We are able to successfully prove the concept of this novel single-sided suturing catheter for EVAR.

AB  - Minimally invasive surgery involves using flexible medical instruments such as endoscopes and catheters. Magnetically actuated catheters can provide improved steering precision over conventional catheters. However, besides the actuation method, an accurate tip position is required for precise control of the medical instruments. In this study, the tip position obtained from transverse 2D ultrasound images and multicore optical shape sensors are combined using a robust sensor fusion algorithm. The tip position is tracked in the ultrasound images using a template-based tracker and a convolutional neural network based tracker, respectively. Experimental results for a rhombus path are presented, where data obtained from both tracking sources are fused using Luenberger and Kalman state estimators. The mean and standard deviation of the Euclidean error for the Luenberger observer is 0.2 ± 0.11 [mm] whereas for the Kalman filter it is 0.18 ± 0.13 [mm], respectively.

AB  - We present a novel, reflection-aware method for 3D sound localization in indoor environments. Unlike prior approaches, which are mainly based on continuous sound signals from a stationary source, our formulation is designed to localize the position instantaneously from signals within a single frame. We consider direct sound and indirect sound signals that reach the microphones after reflecting off surfaces such as ceilings or walls. We then generate and trace direct and reflected acoustic paths using inverse acoustic ray tracing and utilize these paths with Monte Carlo localization to estimate a 3D sound source position. We have implemented our method on a robot with a cube-shaped microphone array and tested it against different settings with continuous and intermittent sound signals with a stationary or a mobile source. Across different settings, our approach can localize the sound with an average distance error of 0.8 m tested in a room of 7 m by 7 m area with 3 m height, including a mobile and non-line-of-sight sound source. We also reveal that the modeling of indirect rays increases the localization accuracy by 40% compared to only using direct acoustic rays.

AB  - We propose to use neural networks for simultaneous detection and localization of multiple sound sources in human-robot interaction. In contrast to conventional signal processing techniques, neural network-based sound source localization methods require fewer strong assumptions about the environment. Previous neural network-based methods have been focusing on localizing a single sound source, which do not extend to multiple sources in terms of detection and localization. In this paper, we thus propose a likelihood-based encoding of the network output, which naturally allows the detection of an arbitrary number of sources. In addition, we investigate the use of sub-band cross-correlation information as features for better localization in sound mixtures, as well as three different network architectures based on different motivations. Experiments on real data recorded from a robot show that our proposed methods significantly outperform the popular spatial spectrum-based approaches.

AB  - Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), an emerging class of aerial drones, are fast turning into high value mobile sensing assets. While MAVs have a large sensory gamut at their disposal; vision continues to dominate the external sensing scene, with limited usability in scenarios that offer acoustic clues. Therefore, we endeavor to provision a MAV auditory system (i.e., ears); and as part of this goal, our preliminary aim is to develop a robust acoustic localization system for detecting sound sources in the physical space-of-interest. However, devising this capability is extremely challenging due to strong ego-noise from the MAV propeller units, which is both wideband and non-stationary. It is well known that beamformers with large sensor arrays can overcome high noise levels; but in an attempt to cater to the platform (i.e., space, payload and computation) constraints of a MAV, we propose DroneEARS: a binaural sensing system for geo-locating sound sources. It combines the benefits of sparse (two elements) sensor array design (for meeting the platform constraints), and our proposed mobility-aided beamforming (for overcoming the severe ego-noise and its other complex characteristics) to significantly enhance the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate the efficacy of DroneEARS by empirical evaluations, and show that it provides a SNR improvement of 15-18 dB compared to many conventional and widely used techniques. This SNR gain translates to a source localization accuracy of approximately 40 cm within a scan region of 6m × 3m , that is, one order of magnitude better than competing methodologies.

AB  - Coal mines pose a high safety risk for human workers. An autonomous inspection drone would enable a coal mine operation to reduce this risk by minimizing the time spent by workers inside the mine. This inspection drone must be highly robust to the harsh and dangerous environment of an underground coal mine, with high levels of coal dust and humidity that can obstruct many conventional sensing methods. For high functionality, the drone must sense and avoid potential obstacles and as well as inspect and map the mining wall face. The objective of this paper is to present ultra-wideband (UWB) radar as a robust sensing solution to this challenging environment and validate its performance experimentally in the typical coal mine environment, both statically and dynamically.

AB  - Smart manufacturing technologies are emerging which combine industrial equipment with Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors to monitor and improve productivity of manufacturing. This allows for new opportunities to explore algorithms for predicting machine failures from attached sensor data. This paper presents a solution to non-invasively upgrade an existing machine with an Inertial Machine Monitoring System (IMMS) to detect and classify equipment failure or degraded state. We also provide a strategy to optimize the amount, placement locations, and efficiency of the sensors. In experiments, the system collected data from 36 inertial sensors placed at multiple locations on a 3D printer. Normal operation vs. 10 types of realworld abnormal equipment behavior (loose belt, failures of machine components) were detected and classified by Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. Using under 1 minute of recording while running a test print, a recursively discovered best subset of 4 to 9 sensors yielded 11-way classification accuracy over 99%. Our results suggest that even a small sensor network and short test program can yield effective detection of machine degraded state and can facilitate early remediation.

AB  - Localisation is of importance for many applications. Our motivating scenarios are short-term construction work and emergency rescue. Not only is accuracy necessary, these scenarios also require rapid setup and robustness to environmental conditions. These requirements preclude the use of many traditional methods e.g. vision-based, laser-based, Ultra-wide band (UWB) and Global Positioning System (GPS)-based localisation systems. To solve these challenges, we introduce iMag, an accurate and rapidly deployable inertial magneto-inductive (MI) localisation system. It localises monitored workers using a single MI transmitter and inertial measurement units with minimal setup effort. However, MI location estimates can be distorted and ambiguous. To solve this problem, we suggest a novel method to use MI devices for sensing environmental distortions, and use these to correctly close inertial loops. By applying robust simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM), our proposed localisation method achieves excellent tracking accuracy, and can improve performance significantly compared with only using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and MI device for localisation.

AB  - Untethered mobile microgrippers exhibit flexibility and agility in small and constrained environments as precise and accurate robotic end-effectors, with promising potential applications in cell manipulation and microassembly. Here, we propose the first scheme to independently and simultaneously position two microgrippers on a horizontal plane for parallel targeted cargo delivery using a single global input. The separation and orientation of the two-microgripper pair are modulated by the local magnetic interactions between the two microgrippers, which are governed by a global magnetic field. The microgripper action of grasping or releasing cargoes is fully controlled by the global magnetic field without requiring additional thermal, chemical, or other stimuli. Thus, the proposed strategy only requires a single input, i.e., a global magnetic field, to control two microgrippers and therefore is simple to implement and fast-acting. As a demonstration, two microgrippers are maneuvered by a global magnetic field to pick up two cargoes and deliver them to their respective destinations. The parallel operation of two microgrippers can potentially double the overall throughput and enable the tasks that require team cooperations. The two 3D microgrippers configuration is intuitive in teleoperations, since it imitates the two-hand case of human beings.

AB  - Retinal Vein Occlusion is a common retinal vascular disorder which can cause severe loss of vision. Retinal vein cannulation followed by injection of an anti-coagulant into the affected vein is a promising treatment. However, given the scale and fragility of the surgical workfield, this procedure is considered too high-risk to perform manually. A first successful robot-assisted procedure has been demonstrated. Even though successful, the procedure remains extremely challenging. This paper aims at providing a solution for the limited perception of instrument-tissue interaction forces as well as depth estimation during retinal vein cannulation. The development of a novel combined force and distance sensing cannulation needle relying on Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) A-scan technology is reported. The design, the manufacturing process, the calibration method, and the experimental characterization of the produced sensor are discussed. The functionality of the combined sensing modalities and the real-time distance estimation algorithm are validated respectively on in-vitro and ex-vivo models.

AB  - Despite several robots having been proposed for vitreoretinal surgery, there is limited information on their dynamic modeling. This gap leads to sub-optimal motor selection and hinders the application of advanced control schemes that would fulfill the goal of micro-precise surgery. This paper presents the design process and a dynamics study of a multi-Degree of Freedom (DoF) robotic system, which is inspired by established co-manipulation architectures. A rigorous kinematics and dynamics analysis of the robot's part that is responsible for manipulating the surgical tool during the retinal surgery phase is provided. In particular, the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, which describe the dynamics of the 3-link surgical manipulator, are combined with novel analytical models of each link's corresponding transmission mechanism, including an anti-backlash lead screw assembly and a worm drive. The resulting models, transferable to existing manipulators, provide a meticulous analysis of the robot's performance that can be used both for mechanical design and control purposes.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers account for 1.5 million deaths worldwide. Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is an advanced therapeutic endoscopy technique with superior clinical outcome due to the minimally invasive and en bloc removal of tumours. In the western world, ESD is seldom carried out, due to its complex and challenging nature. Various surgical systems are being developed to make this therapy accessible, however, these solutions have shown limited operational workspace, dexterity, or low force exertion capabilities. The current paper shows the ESD CYCLOPS system, a bimanual surgical robotic attachment that can be mounted at the end of any flexible endoscope. The system is able to achieve forces of up to 46N, and showed a mean error of 0.217mm during an elliptical tracing task. The workspace and instrument dexterity is shown by pre-clinical ex vivo trials, in which ESD is successfully performed by a GI surgeon. The system is currently undergoing pre-clinical in vivo validation.

AB  - Micro-robots have a great application prospect in the biomedical field due to the feature of small size. To solve the issues of energy supply and bio-compatibility of micro-robots, bio-syncretic micro-robots composed of biological materials and electromechanical systems have been studied widely. The skeletal muscle is a potential material to develop bio-actuator for the bio-syncretic robots on account of the great contraction force and the controllability. However, the low differentiation quality of C2C12s and the control of the bio-syncretic robots are the two of the main challenges for the development of the bio-syncretic robots based on the skeleton muscle. In this paper, an approach based on circularly distributed multiple electrodes (CDMEs) was proposed to improve the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells and characterize the electro-responsive beating behavior of myotubes for the development of bio-syncretic robots. Three groups of C2C12 blasts were used to fulfill the differentiation experiments without electrical stimulation and with electrical stimulation using parallel electrodes and CDMEs respectively, for evaluating the effect of CDMEs on C2C12 differentiation. It was demonstrated that electrical field through CDMEs can improve the differentiation quality of C2C12 blasts into myotubes in terms of intensity, length, and widths. Then, the effect of electrical stimulation on the beating behaviors of myotubes was also investigated with CDMEs, and it was shown that the beating amplitudes of myotubes were significantly affected by the frequencies, amplitude and direction of electrical stimulation with respect to the myotubes, which is fundamental for the control of the micro-robot based on skeletal muscle cells. The proposed approach is useful for not only the development of the bio-syncretic robots, but also the study of muscle tissue engineering.

AB  - Recently, the demand to manipulate deformable objects such as a string and cloth by robots is growing. The reason is that it has the possibility of making our lives more convenient in many domains. The manipulation of deformable objects, however, is more difficult than that of rigid objects, because deformable objects have diversity of shape and behavior. Therefore, our research group has been focusing on the string shape operation. This paper describes planning method of string untying operation based on knot theory and algorithms to generate the motion of a manipulator. The novel contribution of our planning method is automatic selection of optimal shape operation based on cost function. At final, the results of string untying experiments are reported.

AB  - The development of soft, compliant force sensors is greatly sought after in areas such as soft robotics and prosthetics. Nevertheless, solutions for measuring forces in multiple axes, while being mechanically compliant, have been few and far between. Here we present a compliant sensor able to detect forces tangential and normal to the sensor surface. The transduction mechanism is based on the deformation of laser-machined carbon fiber composite (CFC) micro-scale meanders, encapsulated within elastomers layers. Strains in the elastomer are transmitted to the meanders, causing changes in the electrical resistance of the sensor contact mechanics. Configuring the meanders in a radial pattern, segmenting them into quadrants (two antagonist pairs) and biasing the center of the sensor out-of-plane enables detection of forces in multiple axis via differential measurement. Sensors were manufactured using a custom fabrication process and exhibited high mechanical compliance with a very low form factor. The sensors were experimentally characterized and demonstrated large differential changes in resistance (up to 26 kΩ for tangential forces applied to the sensor surface). We integrated our sensor onto a soft robotic gripper finger and demonstrated the ability to detect changes in friction at the actuator surface, thus demonstrating their potential for real world applications.

AB  - Thanks to the growing interest in soft robotics, hydropneumatics and inflatable system dynamics are attracting renewed attention from the scientific community. Typical fluidic systems are composed of several chambers and require a complex and bulky network of active components for their control. This paper presents a novel approach to fluidic actuation, which consists in the co-design of both the mechanical parameters of the system and of custom input signals, to enable the elicitation of different behaviors of the system with fewer control components. The principle is presented in theory and simulation and then experimentally validated through the application to a case study, an in-pipe inchworm-like robot. It is shown that it is possible to obtain forward and backward movements by modulating a unique input.

AB  - Pneumatic stepper motors are one of the promising alternative actuation methods for motion control in environments where electromagnetic (EM) motors cannot be used. Due to the lack of commercial off-the-shelf products, researchers working on MR compatible robotics have to develop their own pneumatic actuators. This imposes extensive costs and delays on the development process. Additionally, the current solutions are limited in their range of specifications and are difficult to manufacture. In this paper, proof-of-concept-prototypes for a family of parametrically designed, electromagnetically stealth, rotational pneumatic stepper motors are presented. The main objective of the paper is to demonstrate a general purpose non-electromagnetic actuation method, which can be customized and integrated into any design. Customizability, miniaturization, safety and affordability are some of the key features of the presented work. The developed prototypes are entirely 3D-printed and contain no sealing, bearing or lubrication. Thanks to the low production cost, the motor can be used as a disposable part in surgical applications. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the design in terms of cost-efficiency, versatility, MRI-compatibility, speed and performance. In order to optimize the design and control algorithm, empirical equations are presented describing response time of a pneumatic system to sequential pressure signals. A rotational speed of 800 rpm, total volume of 4.6 cm3 and resolution of 3° are some of the design attributes. The effects of clearance on stick-slip effect and leakage in a 3D printed cylinder-piston are also presented.

AB  - Path planning classically focuses on avoiding environmental contact. However, some assembly tasks permit contact through compliance, and such contact may allow for more efficient and reliable solutions under action uncertainty. But, optimal manipulation plans that leverage environmental contact are difficult to compute. Environmental contact produces complex kinematics that create difficulties for planning. This complexity is usually addressed by discretization over state and action space, but discretization quickly becomes computationally intractable. To overcome the challenge, we use the insight that only actions on configurations near the contact manifold are likely to involve complex kinematics, while segments of the plan through free space do not. Leveraging this structure can greatly reduce the number of states considered and scales much better with problem complexity. We develop an algorithm based on this idea and show that it performs comparably to full MDP solutions at a fraction of the computational cost.

AB  - This paper presents a novel constrained, sampling-based motion planning method for grasp and transport tasks with a redundant robotic manipulator. We utilize a planning margin for grasping with constraints that allow the best grasp configuration and approach direction to be determined automatically. For manipulators with many degrees of freedom, our method efficiently chooses the optimal grasp pose when there are many redundant solutions. The method also introduces a parameterized intermediate pose that is optimized to determine the approach direction, increasing robustness under sensor uncertainty and execution errors. Our method also considers transporting the grasped object to the desired target position using a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm that incorporates soft constraints via appropriate cost penalties. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms on a number of simulated and experimental applications. Our experimental results show a marked improvement in computational efficiency in comparison to previously studied approaches.

AB  - This paper explores the problem of autonomous, in-hand regrasping-the problem of moving from an initial grasp on an object to a desired grasp using the dexterity of a robot's fingers. We propose a planner for this problem which alternates between finger gaiting, and in-grasp manipulation. Finger gaiting enables the robot to move a single finger to a new contact location on the object, while the remaining fingers stably hold the object. In-grasp manipulation moves the object to a new pose relative to the robot's palm, while maintaining the contact locations between the hand and object. Given the object's geometry (as a mesh), the hand's kinematic structure, and the initial and desired grasps, we plan a sequence of finger gaits and object reposing actions to reach the desired grasp without dropping the object. We propose an optimization based approach and report in-hand regrasping plans for 5 objects over 5 in-hand regrasp goals each. The plans generated by our planner are collision free and guarantee kinematic feasibility.

AB  - The complex physical properties of highly deformable materials such as clothes pose significant challenges for autonomous robotic manipulation systems. We present a novel visual feedback dictionary-based method for manipulating deformable objects towards a desired configuration. Our approach is based on visual servoing and we use an efficient technique to extract key features from the RGB sensor stream in the form of a histogram of deformable model features. These histogram features serve as high-level representations of the state of the deformable material. Next, we collect manipulation data and use a visual feedback dictionary that maps the velocity in the high-dimensional feature space to the velocity of the robotic end-effectors for manipulation. We have evaluated our approach on a set of complex manipulation tasks and human-robot manipulation tasks on different cloth pieces with varying material characteristics.

AB  - This paper presents a reactive controller for planar manipulation tasks that leverages machine learning to achieve real-time performance. The approach is based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation, where the goal is to find an optimal sequence of robot motions to achieve a desired object motion. Due to the multiple contact modes associated with frictional interactions, the resulting optimization program suffers from combinatorial complexity when tasked with determining the optimal sequence of modes. To overcome this difficulty, we formulate the search for the optimal mode sequences offline, separately from the search for optimal control inputs online. Using tools from machine learning, this leads to a convex hybrid MPC program that can be solved in real-time. We validate our algorithm on a planar manipulation experimental setup where results show that the convex hybrid MPC formulation with learned modes achieves good closed-loop performance on a trajectory tracking problem.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to in-hand manipulation planning that exploits the mechanics of alternating sticking contact. Particularly, we consider the problem of manipulating a grasped object using external pushes for which the pusher sticks to the object. Given the physical properties of the object, frictional coefficients at contacts and a desired regrasp on the object, we propose a sampling-based planning framework that builds a pushing strategy concatenating different feasible stable pushes to achieve the desired regrasp. An efficient dynamics formulation allows us to plan in-hand manipulations 100-1000 times faster than our previous work which builds upon a complementarity formulation. Experimental observations for the generated plans show that the object precisely moves in the grasp as expected by the planner.

AB  - Rearranging objects on a tabletop surface by means of nonprehensile manipulation is a task which requires skillful interaction with the physical world. Usually, this is achieved by precisely modeling physical properties of the objects, robot, and the environment for explicit planning. In contrast, as explicitly modeling the physical environment is not always feasible and involves various uncertainties, we learn a nonprehensile rearrangement strategy with deep reinforcement learning based on only visual feedback. For this, we model the task with rewards and train a deep Q-network. Our potential field-based heuristic exploration strategy reduces the amount of collisions which lead to suboptimal outcomes and we actively balance the training set to avoid bias towards poor examples. Our training process leads to quicker learning and better performance on the task as compared to uniform exploration and standard experience replay. We demonstrate empirical evidence from simulation that our method leads to a success rate of 85%, show that our system can cope with sudden changes of the environment, and compare our performance with human level performance.

The agents can control the payload to track a reference trajectory in linear and angular velocity with center-of-mass measurements, in angular velocity using only local measurements and a common frame, and can stabilize its rotation with only local measurements. The controller is designed via a Lyapunov-style analysis and has proven stability and convergence. The controller is validated in simulation and experimentally with four robots manipulating an object in the plane.

AB  - In this paper we propose a novel general method to let a dynamical system fulfil at best a control task when the nominal parameters are not perfectly known. The approach is based on the introduction of the novel concept of closed-loop sensitivity, a quantity that relates parameter variations to deviations of the closed-loop trajectory of the system/controller pair. This new definition takes into account the dependency of the control inputs from the system states and nominal parameters as well as from the controller dynamics. The reference trajectory to be tracked is taken as optimization variable, and the dynamics of both the sensitivity and of its gradient are computed analytically along the system trajectories. We then show how this computation can be effectively exploited for solving trajectory optimization problems aimed at generating a reference trajectory that minimizes a norm of the closed-loop sensitivity. The theoretical results are validated via an extensive campaign of Monte Carlo simulations for two relevant robotic systems: a unicycle and a quadrotor UAV.

AB  - We consider a virtual manipulator in grasping scenarios which allows us to capture the effect of the object dynamics. This modeling approach turns a multi-arm robot into an underactuated system. We observe that controlling floating-base multi-leg robots is fundamentally similar. The Projected Inverse Dynamics Control approach is employed for decoupling contact consistent motion generation and controlling contact wrenches. The proposed framework for underactuated robots has been evaluated on an enormous robot hand composed of four KUKA LWR IV+ representing fingers cooperatively manipulating a 9kg box with total 28 actuated DOF and six virtual DOF representing the object as additional free-floating robot link. Finally, we validate the same approach on ANYmal, a floating-base quadruped with 12 actuated DOF. Experiments are performed both in simulation and real world.

AB  - In this work we introduced a prioritized Cartesian impedance control under the framework of the Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization. In particular, we present a formulation which is simpler than full inverse dynamics, avoids any matrix pseudo-inversion, inverse kinematics computation and considers strict priorities among tasks. Our formulation is based on QP optimization permitting to take into account also explicit inequality constraints. We compare in simulation the tracking results obtained with a classical algebraic implementation against those derived from the proposed QP implementation taking into account joint torque limits. We consider the classical Cartesian impedance controller and a simplified version, also known as Virtual Model Control. Finally the proposed method was implemented and validated on a humanoid upper-body torque controlled robot. Experimental trials involving various physical interaction conditions were executed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

AB  - The need for temporal and spatial coordination of two robot arms moving independently in a shared workspace frequently arises in industrial and service-oriented robotics alike. Today, this problem is often solved manually, leading to a negative impact on user experience as well as on execution performance. In this paper, we present an algorithm that is able to automatically coordinate independently planned motions of a dual-arm manipulator during execution. In addition, the algorithm is capable of refining the plan upon receiving new motion commands during the robot motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on an ABB YuMi robot working on an industrial palletizing task.

AB  - A model-based Machine Learning (ML) approach is presented to detect and localize external contacts on a 6 degree of freedom (DoF) serial manipulator. This approach only requires the use of proprioceptive sensors (joint positions, velocities and one-dimensional (ID) joint torques already available in the robot arm). Good results are obtained with Random Forests (RFs) and Multi-Layer-Perceptrons (MLPs) leading to a precise localization of the contact link and its orientation. Apart from the link in contact and the orientation of the force, RFs and MLPs are also able to differentiate between contact points on the same link and orientation but with different distances to the joint axis. We experimentally verify this approach on simulated and real data obtained from the Kinova Jaco 2 manipulator and compare it to an optimization based approach.

AB  - This paper revisits computed torque method for robot manipulators and aims at developing its new framework based on the L1 robustness, in which the L∞ norm together with its induced norm is employed to characterize model uncertainties and a performance measure. More precisely, we consider the L1 robust stability and performance for a given robot manipulator with a computed torque controller. We first show that the modelling errors in the computed torque method can be divided into an exogenous disturbance and a multiplicative model uncertainty, which are bounded in terms of the L∞ norm and its induced norm, respectively. It is next shown that the robot manipulator with the computed torque controller can be equivalently represented by an interconnection of a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) nominal plant and a stabilizing controller together with the L∞-induced norm bounded model uncertainty. Based on the interconnected representation, the L1 robust stability condition and an upper bound of the L1 performance against the exogenous disturbance with respect to all model uncertainties in a class of a bounded L∞-induced norm are dealt with by using the small-gain theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated through some experiment results.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a framework for online quadrotor motion planning for autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Based on the onboard state estimation and environment perception, we adopt a fast marching-based path searching method to find a path on a velocity field induced by the Euclidean signed distance field (ESDF) of the map, to achieve better time allocation. We generate a flight corridor for the quadrotor to travel through by inflating the path against the environment. We represent the trajectory as piecewise Bézier curves by using Bernstein polynomial basis and formulate the trajectory generation problem as typical convex programs. By using Bézier curves, we are able to bound positions and higher order dynamics of the trajectory entirely within safe regions. The proposed motion planning method is integrated into a customized light-weight quadrotor platform and is validated by presenting fully autonomous navigation in unknown cluttered indoor and outdoor environments. We also release our code for trajectory generation as an open-source package.

AB  - In the coverage path planning problem, a common assumption is that the robot can fully cover the environment without recharging. However, in reality most mobile robot systems operate under battery limitations. To incorporate this constraint, we consider the problem when the working environment is large and the robot needs to recharge multiple times to fully cover the environment. We focus on a geometric version where the environment is represented as a polygonal grid with a single charging station. Energy consumption throughout the environment is assumed to be uniform and proportional to the distance traveled. We first present a constant-factor approximation algorithm for contour-connected environments. We then extend the algorithm for general environments. We also validate the results in experiments performed with an aerial robot.

AB  - We introduce an extension of the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods into the 3D space in which a fixed-wing aerial vehicle is requested to visit a set of target regions while the vehicle motion constraints are satisfied, i.e., the minimum turning radius and maximum climb and dive angles. The primary challenge is to address both the combinatorial optimization part of finding the sequence of target visits and the continuous optimization part of the final trajectory determination. Due to its high complexity, we propose to address both parts of the problem separately by a decoupled approach in which the sequence is determined by a new distance function designed explicitly for the utilized 3D Dubins Airplane model. The final trajectory is then found by a local optimization which improves the solution quality. The proposed approach provides significantly better solutions than using Euclidean distance in the sequencing part of the problem. Moreover, the found solutions are of the competitive quality to the sampling-based algorithm while its computational requirements are about two orders of magnitude lower.

Analysis of the arm Jacobian yields a further geometric interpretations of optimal paths, constraining the locations of rotation centers and the directions of translations that may occur along optimal paths.

AB  - Motion planning is an extremely well-studied problem in the robotics community, yet existing work largely falls into one of two categories: computationally efficient but with few if any safety guarantees, or able to give stronger guarantees but at high computational cost. This work builds on a recent development called FaSTrack in which a slow offline computation provides a modular safety guarantee for a faster online planner. We introduce the notion of “meta-planning” in which a refined offline computation enables safe switching between different online planners. This provides autonomous systems with the ability to adapt motion plans to a priori unknown environments in real-time as sensor measurements detect new obstacles, and the flexibility to maneuver differently in the presence of obstacles than they would in free space, all while maintaining a strict safety guarantee. We demonstrate the meta-planning algorithm both in simulation and in hardware using a small Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor.

AB  - Reactivity to unexpected situations is one of the most important characteristics of walking for real world applications. In this study, we introduce a reactive biped robot walking method that reflects only the current state of the robot. Therefore, time plan and trajectory tracking control are not required for robot walking, and this enables reactive behavior to unexpected contact or disturbance. The walking algorithm is realized through a whole-body control algorithm based on the operational space control framework, that possesses the capability to command the required force for tasks and also implement compliant task behavior by adjusting corresponding task gains. The performance of the proposed method is verified by experiments with a 12-DoF torque controlled biped robot. Robust walking is demonstrated when the foot is stopped by an unexpected obstacle or when the lateral motion is unexpectedly blocked and released by a human.

AB  - Actuator modules of humanoid robots have relatively higher joint elasticity than those of industrial robots. Such joint elasticity could lead to negative effects on both the tracking performance and stability for walking. Especially, unstable contact between the foot and ground caused by joint elasticity is a critical problem, as it decreases the stability of position-controlled humanoid robots. To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel control scheme for position-controlled humanoid robots by which we can obtain not only enhance compliance capability for unknown contact but also suppress the vibration caused by joint elasticity. To estimate the disturbance caused by external forces and modeling errors between the actual system and nominal system, a disturbance observer based estimator is designed at each joint. Furthermore, a linear feedback controller for the flexible joint model and a gravity compensator is considered to reduce vibration and deflection due to the joint elasticity. The proposed control scheme was implemented on our humanoid robot, DYROS-JET, and its performance was demonstrated by improved stability during dynamic walking and stepping on objects.

AB  - This work presents a method for contact state estimation using fuzzy clustering to learn contact probability for full, six-dimensional humanoid contacts. The data required for training is solely from proprioceptive sensors - endeffector contact wrench sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) - and the method is completely unsupervised. The resulting cluster means are used to efficiently compute the probability of contact in each of the six endeffector degrees of freedom (DoFs) independently. This clustering-based contact probability estimator is validated in a kinematics-based base state estimator in a simulation environment with realistic added sensor noise for locomotion over rough, low-friction terrain on which the robot is subject to foot slip and rotation. The proposed base state estimator which utilizes these six DoF contact probability estimates is shown to perform considerably better than that which determines kinematic contact constraints purely based on measured normal force.

AB  - The control of walking robots has been a long-studied problem as researchers attempt to bring robots out of the lab and into unstructured environments. In particular, there is significant interest in dynamic walkers: a class of walking robots that exhibit highly efficient gaits, but are sensitive to disturbances. This paper develops robust controllers for dynamic walkers in transverse coordinates using H∞ control, with a focus on rejecting disturbances at foot impact. The optimization objective is a measure of disturbance rejection known as the gait sensitivity norm. The controller was used to stabilise a compass gait walker in simulation for various disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of phase-tracking and H∞ control for robustness compared to time-varying and LQR controllers.

AB  - Rapid acceleration manoeuvres have been avoided by researchers due to the aperiodicity and complexities of this motion. With the recent improvements in optimal control, this paper presents the first examination of a biped completing a time optimal sprint, starting and ending in rest, to provide insight for parameter choices of a robotic platform. In particular, a realistic linkage morphology is used with the limitation of a pre-specified actuator to choose the nominal leg length and gear ratio. Due to the size of the optimisation problem, a brute force approach is used rather than including these parameters as free variables. The results provided unique motion trajectories for time optimal behaviour with the models reaching near steady state motion and performing manoeuvres that are seen in a biped's biological counterpart. We then show that access to a higher mass-specific force does not improve the rapid acceleration manoeuvres, rather the friction coefficient and keeping the feet near the ground act as the limiting factor given sufficiently powerful actuators. A parabolic relationship emerged for sprint time versus linkage lengths providing valuable insight into the parameters to use for the platform design. To the authors knowledge, no prior research has focused on rapid acceleration and braking manoeuvres of a biped in one optimisation problem, let alone providing insight for the physical bipedal robotic platform.

AB  - This paper studies bipedal locomotion as a nonlinear optimization problem based on continuous and discrete dynamics, by simultaneously optimizing the remaining step duration, the next step duration and the foot location to achieve robustness. The linear inverted pendulum as the motion model captures the center of mass dynamics and its low-dimensionality makes the problem more tractable. We first formulate a holistic approach to search for optimality in the three-dimensional parametric space and use these results as baseline. To further improve computational efficiency, our study investigates a sequential approach with two stages of customized optimization that first optimizes the current step duration, and subsequently the duration and location of the next step. The effectiveness of both approaches is successfully demonstrated in simulation by applying different perturbations. The comparison study shows that these two approaches find mostly the same optimal solutions, but the latter requires considerably less computational time, which suggests that the proposed sequential approach is well suited for real-time implementation with a minor trade-off in optimality.

AB  - This paper presents methods that facilitate the implementation of dynamic walking on torque-controlled robots in real world experiments. The work uses the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) for walking trajectory generation and control. The DCM controller is embedded into a whole-body controller (WBC) that produces a full-body walking behavior. While in simulation the combination of DCM and WBC is sufficient for achieving sophisticated walking gaits, during our initial experiments several real-world issues, detailed in this paper, prevented the original control framework from functioning. This work presents the improvements to the original control framework that enabled a breakthrough on the way to achieving torque-based dynamic walking on a real robot.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel fall control technique based on energy concepts, which can be applied online to mitigate the impact forces incurred during the falling over of humanoids. The technique reduces the total energy using a nonlinear control tool, called energy shaping (ES), and further distributes the reduced energy over multiple contacts by means of energy distribution polygons (EDP). We also include an effective orientation control to safeguard the end-effectors in the event of ground impacts. The performance of the proposed method is numerically evaluated by dynamic simulations under the sudden falling over scenario of the humanoid robot for both lateral and sagittal falls. The effectiveness of the proposed ES and EDP concepts are verified by diverse comparative simulations with total energy, distribution, and impact forces.

Despite many years of research and development efforts, the low-cost, low-power, compact tactile display remains elusive. This paper describes a low-cost electromechanical actuator array based on low-force, low-displacement bistable actuators that can be realized using inexpensive, commercially available components and high-volume manufacturing processes. The array is applicable to several types of tactile displays; as an initial proof of concept, we demonstrate a 6-dot Braille cell with a 3mm pitch that requires less than 50mJ per actuator per transition.

AB  - The present paper investigates if and in which conditions does the implementation of high stiffness controllers increase the performances of human dyads during comanipulative tasks in physical Human-Human Interaction (pHHI) settings. Two experiments are conducted which cover two fundamental aspects of pHHI: low-level interactions allowing interpersonal coordination, and high-level interactions allowing common decision-making and negotiation of strategies. The results of these experiments show that high stiffness is not necessary for good performances when the task only requires low-level interactions. On the contrary, when dealing with high-level interactions, higher stiffness increases task performance. The results presented highlight the importance of the quality of teleoperated control in setups used for the study of pHHI.

AB  - As the field of haptics in virtual reality expands, wearable devices are being explored as alternatives to traditional kinesthetic force feedback devices, which are often limited in workspace. Skin deformation feedback offers a user-grounded feedback modality that mimics cutaneous interactions with the real world but can suffer from force-output saturation due to the actuation constraints required to achieve a small form factor. Saturation of haptic devices limits the mechanical properties and interactions that can be rendered in a virtual environment, specifically the weight that can be rendered when a user manipulates a virtual object. We use scaled inertial forces to alter virtual weight perception during a dynamic grasp-lift-and-place task in a virtual environment with haptic feedback via two wearable skin deformation feedback devices. A study was conducted, beginning with an open response exercise to assess how participants interpreted scaled inertial forces when interacting with virtual blocks. Participants then performed a series of trials to measure the Point of Subjective Equality of virtual weight with scaled inertial forces, using a reference of 200 g under the normal (no scaling) condition. PSEs for inertial scaling factors of 2 and 3 were 171 g and 151 g, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a unique haptic rendering algorithm that can convey larger weights without saturating the force output of the haptic device.

AB  - Latency and refresh rate are known to adversely affect human force perception in bilateral teleoperators and virtual environments using kinesthetic force feedback, motivating the use of sensory substitution of force. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effects of latency and refresh rate on force perception using sensory substitution by skin deformation feedback. A force-controlled skin deformation feedback device was attached to a 3-degree-of-freedom kinesthetic force feedback device used for position tracking and gravity support. A human participant study was conducted to determine the effects of latency and refresh rate on perceived stiffness and damping with skin deformation feedback. Participants compared two virtual objects: a comparison object with stiffness or damping that could be tuned by the participant, and a reference object with either added latency or reduced refresh rate. Participants modified the stiffness or damping of the tunable object until it resembled the stiffness or damping of the reference object. We found that added latency and reduced refresh rate both increased perceived stiffness but had no effect on perceived damping. Specifically, participants felt significantly different stiffness when the latency exceeded 300 ms and the refresh rate dropped below 16.6 Hz. The impact of latency and refresh rate on force perception via skin deformation feedback was significantly less than what has been previously shown for kinesthetic force feedback.

AB  - In this paper we present KnowRob2, a second generation knowledge representation and reasoning framework for robotic agents. KnowRob2 is an extension and partial redesign of KnowRob, currently one of the most advanced knowledge processing systems for robots that has enabled them to successfully perform complex manipulation tasks such as making pizza, conducting chemical experiments, and setting tables. The knowledge base appears to be a conventional first-order time interval logic knowledge base, but it exists to a large part only virtually: many logical expressions are constructed on demand from data structures of the control program, computed through robotics algorithms including ones for motion planning and solving inverse kinematics problems, and log data stored in noSQL databases. Novel features and extensions of KnowRob2 substantially increase the capabilities of robotic agents of acquiring open-ended manipulation skills and competence, reasoning about how to perform manipulation actions more realistically, and acquiring commonsense knowledge.

This paper presents an approach to intuitively create (sub-)skills. General guidelines for assembly process descriptions #2860 provided by the Association of German Engineers VDI are applied to robot programming, in particular addressing assembly applications. The guidelines are exemplarily applied to the constraint-based approach iTaSC (instantaneous Task Specification using Constraints), presenting a procedure to hierarchically combine elementary processes to (sub-)skills. Six elementary processes are identified to be sufficient to implement a wide variety of assembly tasks. An iTaSC implementation was developed and two exemplarily assembly tasks were realized to evaluate the approach.

AB  - This paper describes a framework called MaestROBe It is designed to make the robots perform complex tasks with high precision by simple high-level instructions given by natural language or demonstration. To realize this, it handles a hierarchical structure by using the knowledge stored in the forms of ontology and rules for bridging among different levels of instructions. Accordingly, the framework has multiple layers of processing components; perception and actuation control at the low level, symbolic planner and Watson APIs for cognitive capabilities and semantic understanding, and orchestration of these components by a new open source robot middleware called Project Intu at its core. We show how this framework can be used in a complex scenario where multiple actors (human, a communication robot, and an industrial robot) collaborate to perform a common industrial task. Human teaches an assembly task to Pepper (a humanoid robot from SoftBank Robotics) using natural language conversation and demonstration. Our framework helps Pepper perceive the human demonstration and generate a sequence of actions for UR5 (collaborative robot arm from Universal Robots), which ultimately performs the assembly (e.g. insertion) task.

AB  - In recent years, many different feedback controllers for robotic applications have been proposed and implemented. However, the high coupling between the different software modules made their integration into one common architecture difficult. Consequently, this has hindered the ability of a user to employ the different controllers into a single, general and modular framework. To address this problem, we present Ctrl-MORE, a software architecture developed to fill the gap between control developers and other users in robotic applications. On one hand, Ctrl-MORE aims to provide developers with an opportunity to integrate easily and share their controllers with other roboticists working in different areas. For example, manipulation, locomotion, vision and so on. On the other hand, it provides to end-users a tool to apply the additional control strategies that guarantee the execution of desired behaviors in a transparent, yet efficient way. The proposed control architecture allows an easier integration of general purpose feedback controllers, such as stabilizers, with higher control layers such as trajectory planners, increasing the robustness of the overall system.

AB  - As a rapidly growing cyber-physical platform, unmanned aerial vehicles are facing more security threats as their capabilities and applications continue to expand. Adversaries with detailed knowledge about the vehicle could orchestrate sophisticated attacks that are not easily detected or handled by the vehicle's control system. In this work, we purpose a generic security framework, termed BlueBox, capable of detecting and handling a variety of cyber-physical attacks. To demonstrate an application of BlueBox in practice, we retrofitted an off-the-shelf quadcopter. A series of attacks were then launched by embedding malicious code in the control software and by altering the vehicle's hardware with the specific targeting of sensors, controller, motors, vehicle dynamics, and operating system. Experimental results verified that BlueBox was capable of both detecting a variety of cyber-physical attacks, while also providing the means in which to recover from such attacks.

AB  - In recent years, a number of publications described approaches for model-based manipulation skills and their applicability to a variety of robot tasks-be it assembly, industrial robotics in general, or service robotics. These approaches roughly follow the same pattern: They model robot task description based on the Task Frame Formalism, the Task Function Approach, or iTaSC. They model coordination mechanisms in form of statecharts or Petri nets. And almost all models are accompanied by domain-specific languages (DSLs) that facilitate creating applications based on those models. While one advantage of using models is their reusability across applications, how to explicitly model the reuse itself has not been fully addressed by these publications. Our paper contributes to this field of research by investigating how reuse can be explicitly modeled using prototype-based inheritance. We base our model on iTaSC and provide a simple yet effective DSL for populating the model and creating applications. We demonstrate our approach by creating a comprehensive library of skills, and by showing the use, reuse and incremental refinement of skills for diverse industrial assembly applications.

AB  - This paper exemplifies the design process for legged machines capable of dynamic behaviors. In order to achieve high performance robots, it is crucial to guarantee harmonious integration between software and hardware. Hence, the development of such capable robotic platforms must address design requirements that meet the assumptions of typical model-based controllers but also respect the physical limitations of a real system. First, we show that proper hardware design choices can greatly aid the control algorithm by approximating the physical robot to the template assumptions. We include actuation and sensing design examples that allows a simple model to capture a major portion of the natural dynamic behavior of the physical machine. Results are applied to a real robot (Figure 1) and we show that the adopted methodology is able to address typical problems in legged robots such as high bandwidth force control and robustness to impact. Finally, a simple model-based balance controller that takes advantage of the fidelity of the template model to the real machine is implemented. These are examples of software-hardware codesign processes that vastly facilitate robotic control.

AB  - This study generates and analyzes unsafe human motions that cannot be measured experimentally in laboratories with dynamic consistency. Detailed whole-body motions are generated by a multilayered kinodynamics simulation (MLKD Sim) that uses a detailed digital whole-body human model and a simple motion-representation model that parametrically represents human motion mechanisms. First, we develop the simple motion-representation model that represents human motion and contact force data that are experimentally measured in a laboratory, and we identify this model's parameters based on these experimental data. Forward dynamics computation of this motion-representation model with changing model and/or environmental parameters simulates motion modification as well as a contact force with dynamic consistency. Finally, the mapping function from the motion-representation model's motion to the detailed motion identified from the experimental data is used to reconstruct the detailed whole-body motion. MLKD Sim reconstructs a vertical contact force with average error of 2.18E+02 N, center of mass trajectory with average error of 3.31E-02 m, ankle joint angle with average error of 1.11E-01 rad (2.95E+00%), and ankle joint torque with average error of 6.13E+01 Nm (1.93E+01%). Unsafe motion simulation results show that the physical load on the hip, knee, and ankle joints increases by 9.23E+01%, 5.42E+02%, and 1.45E+02% respectively with 0.5-m level difference in a running surface. These results imply that when sprinting in an unknown environment, we need to protect, in order, the knee ankle, and hip joints. This study conducts detailed dynamics and kinematics analysis of unsafe human motions that cannot be measured experimentally in laboratories to prevent injuries, falls, and fatigue, and these results should find applications in the fields of medicine and welfare.

AB  - Users play an integral role in the performance of many robotic systems, and robotic systems must account for differences in users to improve collaborative performance. Much of the work in adapting to users has focused on designing teleoperation controllers that adjust to extrinsic user indicators such as force, or intent, but do not adjust to intrinsic user qualities. In contrast, the Human-Robot Interaction community has extensively studied intrinsic user qualities, but results may not rapidly be fed back into autonomy design. Here we provide foundational evidence for a new strategy that augments current shared control, and provide a mechanism to directly feed back results from the HRI community into autonomy design. Our evidence is based on a study examining the impact of the user quality “locus of control” on telepresence robot performance. Our results support our hypothesis that key user qualities can be inferred from human-robot interactions (such as through path deviation or time to completion) and that switching or adaptive autonomies might improve shared control performance.

AB  - While reinforcement learning has led to promising results in robotics, defining an informative reward function is challenging. Prior work considered including the human in the loop to jointly learn the reward function and the optimal policy. Generating samples from a physical robot and requesting human feedback are both taxing efforts for which efficiency is critical. We propose to learn reward functions from both the robot and the human perspectives to improve on both efficiency metrics. Learning a reward function from the human perspective increases feedback efficiency by assuming that humans rank trajectories according to a low-dimensional outcome space. Learning a reward function from the robot perspective circumvents the need for a dynamics model while retaining the sample efficiency of model-based approaches. We provide an algorithm that incorporates bi-perspective reward learning into a general hierarchical reinforcement learning framework and demonstrate the merits of our approach on a toy task and a simulated robot grasping task.

AB  - This project seeks to generate small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) flight paths that are broadly understood by the general population and can communicate states about both the sUAS and its understanding of the world. Previous work in sUAS flight paths has sought to communicate intent, destination, or emotion of the system without focusing on concrete states (e.g., low battery, landing, etc.). This work leverages biologically-based flight paths and experimental methodologies from human-human and human-humanoid robot interactions to assess the understanding of avian flight paths to communicate sUAS states to novice users. If successful, this work should inform: the human-robot interaction community about the perception of flight paths, sUAS manufacturers on how their systems could communicate with both operators and bystanders, and end users on ways to communicate with others when flying systems in public spaces. General design implications and future directions of work are suggested to build on the results here, which suggest that novice users gravitate towards labels they understand (draw attention and landing) while avoiding more technical labels (lost sensor).

AB  - This paper introduces a new method for inverse reinforcement learning in large state spaces, where the learned reward function can be used to control high-dimensional robot systems and analyze complex human movement. To avoid solving the computationally expensive reinforcement learning problems in reward learning, we propose a function approximation method to ensure that the Bellman Optimality Equation always holds, and then estimate a function to maximize the likelihood of the observed motion. The time complexity of the proposed method is linearly proportional to the cardinality of the action set, thus it can handle large state spaces efficiently. We test the proposed method in a simulated environment on reward learning, and show that it is more accurate than existing methods and significantly better in scalability. We also show that the proposed method can extend many existing methods to large state spaces. We then apply the method to evaluating the effect of rehabilitative stimulations on patients with spinal cord injuries based on the observed patient motions.

AB  - In this paper we develop an approach for learning user preferences for complex task specifications through human-robot interaction. We consider the problem of planning robot motion in a known environment, but where a user has specified additional spatial and temporal constraints on allowable robot motions. To illustrate the impact of the user's constraints on performance, we iteratively present users with alternative solutions on an interface. The user provides a ranking of alternate paths, and from this we learn about the importance of different constraints. This allows for an accessible method for specifying complex robot tasks. We present an algorithm that iteratively builds a set of constraints on the relative importance of each user constraint, and prove that with sufficient interaction, the algorithm determines a user-optimal path. We demonstrate the practical performance by simulating realistic material transport scenarios in industrial facilities.

AB  - In this paper, we present a new approach for efficient regression-based object tracking. Our approach is closely related to the Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks (GOTURN) framework [1]. We make the following contributions. First, we demonstrate that there is a theoretical relationship between Siamese regression networks like GOTURN and the classical Inverse Compositional Lucas & Kanade (IC-LK) algorithm. Further, we demonstrate that unlike GOTURN, IC-LK adapts its regressor to the appearance of the current tracked frame. We argue that the lack of such property in GOTURN attributes to its poor performance on unseen objects and/or viewpoints. Second, we propose a novel framework for object tracking inspired by the IC-LK framework, which we refer to as Deep-LK. Finally, we show impressive results demonstrating that Deep-LK substantially outperforms GOTURN and demonstrate comparable tracking performance against current state-of-the-art deep trackers on high frame-rate sequences whilst being an order of magnitude (100 FPS) computationally efficient.

We evaluate our model in the challenging KITTI dataset and show very competitive results.

AB  - This paper focuses on visual tracking of a robotic manipulator during manipulation. In this situation, tracking is prone to failure when visual distractions are created by the object being manipulated and the clutter in the environment. Current state-of-the-art approaches, which typically rely on model-fitting using Iterative Closest Point (ICP), fail in the presence of distracting data points and are unable to recover. Meanwhile, discriminative methods which are trained only to distinguish parts of the tracked object can also fail in these scenarios as data points from the occlusions are incorrectly classified as being from the manipulator. We instead propose to use the per-pixel data-to-model associations provided from a random forest to avoid local minima during model fitting. By training the random forest with artificial occlusions we can achieve increased robustness to occlusion and clutter present in the scene. We do this without specific knowledge about the type or location of the manipulated object. Our approach is demonstrated by using dense depth data from an RGB-D camera to track a robotic manipulator during manipulation and in presence of occlusions.

AB  - Planar object tracking is an actively studied problem in vision-based robotic applications. While several benchmarks have been constructed for evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms, there is a lack of video sequences captured in the wild rather than in constrained laboratory environment. In this paper, we present a carefully designed planar object tracking benchmark containing 210 videos of 30 planar objects sampled in the natural environment. In particular, for each object, we shoot seven videos involving various challenging factors, namely scale change, rotation, perspective distortion, motion blur, occlusion, out-of-view, and unconstrained. The ground truth is carefully annotated semi-manually to ensure the quality. Moreover, eleven state-of-the-art algorithms are evaluated on the benchmark using two evaluation metrics, with detailed analysis provided for the evaluation results. We expect the proposed benchmark to benefit future studies on planar object tracking.

AB  - Tracking planar objects has a wide range of applications in robotics. Conventional template tracking algorithms, however, often fail to observe fast object motion or drift significantly after a period of time, due to drastic object appearance change. To address such challenges, we propose a novel constrained confidence matching algorithm for motion estimation and a robust Kalman filter for template updating. Integrated with an accurate occlusion detector, our approach achieves accurate motion estimation in presence of partial occlusion, by excluding occluded pixels from computation of motion parameters. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter employs a novel control-input model to handle the object appearance change, which brings our tracker high robustness against sudden illumination change and heavy motion blur. For evaluation, we compare the proposed tracker with several state-of-the-art planar object trackers on two public benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves robust tracking results against various environmental variations, and outperforms baseline algorithms remarkably on both datasets.

AB  - We consider the problems of learning forward models that map state to high-dimensional images and inverse models that map high-dimensional images to state in robotics. Specifically, we present a perceptual model for generating video frames from state with deep networks, and provide a framework for its use in tracking and prediction tasks. We show that our proposed model greatly outperforms standard deconvolutional methods and GANs for image generation, producing clear, photo-realistic images. We also develop a convolutional neural network model for state estimation and compare the result to an Extended Kalman Filter to estimate robot trajectories. We validate all models on a real robotic system.

AB  - We introduce ModQuad, a novel flying modular robotic structure that is able to self-assemble in midair and cooperatively fly. The structure is composed by agile flying modules that can easily move in a three dimensional environment. The module is based on a quadrotor platform within a cuboid frame which allows it to attach to other modules by matching vertical faces. Using this mechanism, a ModQuad swarm is able to rapidly assemble flying structures in midair using the robot bodies as building units. In this paper, we focus on two important tasks for modular flying structures. First, we propose a decentralized modular attitude controller to allow a team of physically connected modules to fly cooperatively. Second, we develop a docking method that drives pairs of structures to be attached in midair. Our method precisely aligns, and corrects motion errors during the docking process. In our experiments, we tested and analyzed the performance of the cooperative flying method for multiple configurations. We also tested the docking method with successful results.

AB  - This work presents a new attitude balancing strategy implemented and validated on a quadrupedal robot equipped with a custom hybrid wheel-legged mobility system. The proposed method uses an inverse kinematics solution scheme based on Quadratic Programming optimization to generate full body motions that ensure the desired balancing performances. The strategy generates a compliant behaviour to cope with the applied external forces resulting in a stable and smooth reaction response. Furthermore, the method takes advantage of the robot hybrid wheeled-legged mobility system to provide new motion capabilities and balancing reactions as it will be shown through the paper. Extensive simulation studies on the Centauro robot are presented. Results show the efficiency of the propose method demonstrating significant contribution in the rejection of the applied external disturbances.

AB  - Constructing a smart wheelchair on a commercially available powered wheelchair (PWC) platform avoids a host of seating, mechanical design and reliability issues but requires methods of predicting and controlling the motion of a device never intended for robotics. Analog joystick inputs are subject to black-box transformations which may produce intuitive and adaptable motion control for human operators, but complicate robotic control approaches; furthermore, installation of standard axle mounted odometers on a commercial PWC is difficult. In this work, we present an integrated hardware and software system for predicting the motion of a commercial PWC platform that does not require any physical or electronic modification of the chair beyond plugging into an industry standard auxiliary input port. This system uses an RGB-D camera and an Arduino interface board to capture motion data, including visual odometry and joystick signals, via ROS communication. Future motion is predicted using an autoregressive sparse Gaussian process model. We evaluate the proposed system on real-world short-term path prediction experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy when compared to a baseline neural network model.

AB  - This paper describes a novel behavior-based local navigation approach for rough off-road scenarios. Trajectory candidates are generated based on vehicle kinematics and dynamics as well as the desired global trajectory. In contrast to on-road local navigation approaches, the work at hand proposes the use of a shiftable elevation grid map instead of occupancy maps since traversability in rough terrains does not only depend on location, but also on the robot's orientation. The traversability is evaluated by determining tire contact points with the terrain to take various different safety and efficiency aspects like underbody collisions and rollover risk into account. By exploiting the behavior-based control paradigm, the navigation approach can be easily extended and its robustness is shown in experimental evaluations using an Unimog U5023.

AB  - Robotic manipulators that are attached to mobile platforms are often used in workspaces that require the end-effector to mobilize beyond the manipulator's limited reach, such as in warehouse shelf stacking and similar applications. However, such assistive robots fall short of completing tasks that require the end-effector to be situated in a specific configuration at a critical time during the task. Traditionally, users control the mobile base to situate the arm such that the task can be completed through continuous operation. This requires an experienced operator who can predict the needed end-effector workspace, and can operate the base accordingly to maximize the likelihood of a successful task while avoiding any floor obstacles. In this work, we propose a straightforward control method that provides sufficient freedom to the end-effector to complete a task that is bound by time-dependent constraints. This is achieved by relaxing the time constraints on the mobile base trajectory in a floor space obstructed by obstacles. The trajectory of the platform is determined by sensor-assisted obstacle avoidance algorithm such that a single degree of freedom mobility can be represented through a safe obstacle-free time-independent path. The proposed control method is implemented in simulation and on physical hardware built in our labs. The simulation included a 5-DoF redundant Planar Mobile Manipulator (PMM). The hardware implementation and testing utilized a 9-DoF redundant mobile manipulator. The implementation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control method in adjusting the mobile platform motion along its allowed obstacle-free path to enable the end-effector to follow its trajectory for task completion that would otherwise fail to complete when conventional control methods are used.

AB  - When designing control strategies for differential-drive mobile robots, one standard tool is the consideration of a point at a fixed distance along a line orthogonal to the wheel axis instead of the full pose of the vehicle. This abstraction supports replacing the non-holonomic, three-state unicycle model with a much simpler two-state single-integrator model (i.e., a velocity-controlled point). Yet this transformation comes at a performance cost, through the robot's precision and maneuverability. This work contains derivations for expressions of these precision and maneuverability costs in terms of the transformation's parameters. Furthermore, these costs show that only selecting the parameter once over the course of an application may cause an undue loss of precision. Model Predictive Control (MPC) represents one such method to ameliorate this condition. However, MPC typically realizes a control signal, rather than a parameter, so this work also proposes a Parametric Model Predictive Control (PMPC) method for parameter and sampling horizon optimization. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the effects of the parameterization on the deployment of algorithms developed for the single-integrator model on actual differential-drive mobile robots.

Equivalent stiffness is proposed and used to characterize the pressure-sinkage property of terrain, while friction angle to characterize the shearing property. Terramechanics model for calculating forces between rigid wheel and soil is proved to be the same with that contact model for calculating forces between rigid wheel and rock. A Digital Elevation Map with Physical Properties is developed and applied to simulate terrain physical properties along with its geometry information. The established methods are validated using simulation and experimental tests with a three-wheel-rover.

AB  - To achieve immersive and natural navigation in a virtual environment through human locomotion, it is necessary to generate a 2-dimensional infinite ground for omnidirectional walking. However, the existing omnidirectional treadmills are heavy, complex and exhibit low acceleration due to power transmission inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel fast-omnidirectional treadmill (F-ODT) with a new power transmission mechanism called the Geared Omni-pulley. This mechanism ensures higher power transmission efficiency for driving the belts of the multiple transversal treadmills for independent Y-axis motion. Due to the improved power transmission performance combined with a simpler and relatively light-weight structure, the proposed 2D treadmill can generate a maximum speed of 3m/sec with an acceleration of 3m/sec2. Based on the improved performance, the F-ODT system can be used as a locomotion interface platform in various virtual reality environments such as training of soldiers, gaming/educational experiences and gait rehabilitation.

The ability to change the diameter of a continuum robot expands the repertoire of kinematic redundancy and enables kinematic parameter adaptation to optimize performance. A continuum robot design based on the angulated scissor mechanism is presented along with its position analysis. An exploration of admissible design parameter values for a given continuum robot segment with a desired maximum curvature while maintaining an open bore along its center is also carried out. A design presenting how this mechanism can be incorporated into a continuum robot is shown and a strategy for minimizing joint forces and avoiding joint limits is formulated as a gradient descent redundancy resolution problem in a simulation case study. The simulation results show that varying the diameter can significantly reduce joint forces while preserving the workspace and avoiding joint limits. This work is a first step towards continuum robots with situational awareness that will use their sensing capabilities to adapt their structure in order to optimize task execution performance.

AB  - In robotic actuation a well identified and modeled friction behavior of the actuator components helps to significantly improve friction compensation, output torque estimation, and dynamic simulations. The friction of two components, i.e. a brush-less DC motor and a harmonic drive gear (HD) is investigated in order to build an accurate dynamic model of the main actuator of the arms of the humanoid David namely the DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ). A dedicated testbed is built to precisely identify input and output torques, temperatures, positions, and elasticities of the investigated components at a controlled environment temperature. Extensive test series are performed in the full velocity operating range in a temperature interval from 24 to 50 °C. The nonlinear influences of velocity and temperature are identified to be dominant effects. It is proposed how to include these nonlinear velocity and temperature dependencies into a static and a dynamic friction model, e.g. LuGre. Dynamic models of the motor and HD are built with the proposed method and experimentally evaluated. The new models are compared to friction models with linear dependencies and show a significant improvement of correspondence with reality.

AB  - This paper presents a novel eddy current damper design for chatter suppression in robotic milling process. The designed eddy current dampers are installed on a milling spindle to damp the tool tip vibrations. The structural design of the eddy current dampers and the working principle of the proposed vibration attenuation method are explained. Finite element method is used to analyze the magnetic flux density and the magnetic force generated by the designed eddy current. The dynamics of the robotic milling system without and with eddy current dampers are modeled, and the damping performance of the proposed method is verified through simulations in both frequency and time domains. The results show that the peaks of the tool tip frequency response function caused by the spindle and milling tool modes are damped by 3.2 dB and 5.3 dB, respectively, and the chatter stability is improved by about 43% in the high spindle speed zone, compared to the case without eddy current dampers.

AB  - One of the main open challenges in visual odometry (VO) is the robustness to difficult illumination conditions or high dynamic range (HDR) environments. The main difficulties in these situations come from both the limitations of the sensors and the inability to perform a successful tracking of interest points because of the bold assumptions in VO, such as brightness constancy. We address this problem from a deep learning perspective, for which we first fine-tune a deep neural network with the purpose of obtaining enhanced representations of the sequences for VO. Then, we demonstrate how the insertion of long short term memory allows us to obtain temporally consistent sequences, as the estimation depends on previous states. However, the use of very deep networks enlarges the computational burden of the VO framework; therefore, we also propose a convolutional neural network of reduced size capable of performing faster. Finally, we validate the enhanced representations by evaluating the sequences produced by the two architectures in several state-of-art VO algorithms, such as ORB-SLAM and DSO.

AB  - In this paper, we present a new direct omnidirectional visual gyroscope for mobile robotic platforms. The gyroscope estimates the 3D orientation of a camera-robot by comparing the current spherical image with that acquired at a reference pose. By transforming pixel intensities into a Mixture of Photometric Potentials, we introduce a novel image-similarity measure which can be seamlessly integrated into a classical nonlinear least-squares optimization scheme, offering an extended convergence domain. Our method provides accurate and robust attitude estimates, and it is easy-to-use since it involves a single tuning parameter, the width of the photometric potentials (Gaussian functions, in this work) controlling the power of attraction of each pixel. The visual gyroscope has been successfully tested on spherical image sequences generated by a twin-fisheye camera mounted on the end-effector of a robot arm and on a fixed-wing UAV.

AB  - Vision-based navigation is extremely susceptible to natural scene changes. This can result in localization failures in less than a few hours after map creation. To combat short-term illumination changes as well as long-term seasonal variations, we propose using a place-and-time-dependent binary descriptor that adapts to different scenarios in an online fashion. This is achieved by extending the GRIEF [6] evolution algorithm in two ways: correspondence generation using a known pose change and the inclusion of LATCH triplets in addition to BRIEF comparisons for descriptor generation. We show the adaptive descriptor outperforms a single descriptor scheme for localization within a single-experience Visual Teach and Repeat (VT&R) system while maintaining the efficiency of binary descriptors. By adapting the description function to different environmental conditions, it allows the system to operate for a longer period before a new experience is required. In the presence of extreme illumination changes from day to night, we obtain 40% more inlier matches compared to SURF. In the case of seasonal variations, a 70% increase is demonstrated. The increased correspondences result in more localizable sections along the paths, amounting to a 25% and 150% increase in the lighting and seasonal cases, respectively.

AB  - Robust velocity and position estimation is crucial for autonomous robot navigation. The optical flow based methods for autonomous navigation have been receiving increasing attentions in tandem with the development of micro unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper proposes a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) based algorithm to determine optical flow using a monocular camera, which is named as correlation flow (CF). Correlation flow is able to provide reliable and accurate velocity estimation and is robust to motion blur. In addition, it can also estimate the altitude velocity and yaw rate, which are not available by traditional methods. Autonomous flight tests on a quadcopter show that correlation flow can provide robust trajectory estimation with very low processing power. The source codes are released based on the ROS framework.

AB  - Use of low-cost depth sensors, such as a stereo camera setup with illuminators, is of particular interest for numerous applications ranging from robotics and transportation to mixed and augmented reality. The ability to quantify noise is crucial for these applications, e.g., when the sensor is used for map generation or to develop a sensor scheduling policy in a multi-sensor setup. Range error models provide uncertainty estimates and help weigh the data correctly in instances where range measurements are taken from different vantage points or with different sensors. Such a model is derived in this work. We show that the range error for stereo systems with integrated illuminators is cubic and validate the proposed model experimentally with an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system. The experiments confirm the validity of the model and simplify the application of this type of sensor in robotics.

AB  - We study how autonomous robots can learn by themselves to improve their depth estimation capability. In particular, we investigate a self-supervised learning setup in which stereo vision depth estimates serve as targets for a convolutional neural network (CNN) that transforms a single still image to a dense depth map. After training, the stereo and mono estimates are fused with a novel fusion method that preserves high confidence stereo estimates, while leveraging the CNN estimates in the low-confidence regions. The main contribution of the article is that it is shown that the fused estimates lead to a higher performance than the stereo vision estimates alone. Experiments are performed on the KITTI dataset, and on board of a Parrot SLAMDunk, showing that even rather limited CNNs can help provide stereo vision equipped robots with more reliable depth maps for autonomous navigation.

AB  - Under- and oversaturation can cause severe image degradation in many vision-based robotic applications. To control camera exposure in dynamic lighting conditions, we introduce a novel metric for image information measure. Measuring an image gradient is typical when evaluating its level of image detail. However, emphasizing more informative pixels substantially improves the measure within an image. By using this entropy weighted image gradient, we introduce an optimal exposure value for vision-based approaches. Using this newly invented metric, we also propose an effective exposure control scheme that covers a wide range of light conditions. When evaluating the function (e.g., image frame grab) is expensive, the next best estimation needs to be carefully considered. Through Bayesian optimization, the algorithm can estimate the optimal exposure value with minimal cost. We validated the proposed image information measure and exposure control scheme via a series of thorough experiments using various exposure conditions.

AB  - Compliant motions allow alignment of workpieces using naturally occurring interaction forces. However, free-floating objects do not have a fixed base to absorb the reaction forces caused by the interactions. Consequently, if the interaction forces are too high, objects can gain momentum and move away after contact. This paper proposes an approach based on direct force control for compliant manipulation of free-floating objects. The objective of the controller is to minimize the interaction forces while maintaining the contact. The proposed approach achieves this by maintaining small constant force along the motion direction and an apparent reduction of manipulator inertia along remaining Degrees of Freedom (DOF). Simulation results emphasize the importance of relative inertia of the robotic manipulator with respect to the free-floating object. The experiments were performed with KUKA LWR4+ manipulator arm and a two-dimensional micro-gravity emulator (object floating on an air bed), which was developed in-house. It was verified that the proposed control law is capable of controlling the interaction forces and aligning the tools without pushing the object away. We conclude that direct force control works better with a free-floating object than implicit force control algorithms, such as impedance control.
