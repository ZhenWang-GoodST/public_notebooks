AB  - This paper presents a robotic gripper design that can perform customizable grasping tasks at the millimeter scale. The design is based on the origami string, a mechanism with a single degree of freedom that can be mechanically programmed to approximate arbitrary paths in space. By using this concept, we create miniature fingers that bend at multiple joints with a single actuator input. The shape and stiffness of these fingers can be varied to fit different grasping tasks by changing the crease pattern of the string. We show that the experimental behavior of these strings follows their analytical models and that they can perform a variety of tasks including pinching, wrapping, and twisting common objects such as pencils, bottle caps, and blueberries.

AB  - This paper presents a method to create fish-like robots with tensegrity systems and describes a prototype modeled on the body shape of the rainbow trout with a length of 400 mm and a mass of 102 g that is driven by a waterproof servomotor. The structure of the tensegrity robot consists of rigid body segments and elastic cables that represent bone/tissue and muscles of fish, respectively. This structural configuration employing the tensegrity class 2 is much simpler than other tensegrity-based underwater robots. It also allows the tuning of the mechanical stiffness, which is often said to be an important factor in fish swimming. In our robot, the body stiffness can be tuned by changing the cross-section of the cables and their pre-stretch ratio. We characterize the robot in terms of body stiffness, swimming speed, and thrust force while varying the body stiffness i.e., the cross-section of the elastic cables. The results show that the body stiffness of the robot can be designed to approximate that of the real fish and modulate its performance characteristics. The measured swimming speed of the robot is 0.23 m/s (0.58 BL/s), which is comparable to other fish robots of the same type. Strouhal number of the robot 0.54 is close to that of the natural counterpart, suggesting that the presented method is an effective engineering approach to realize the swimming characteristics of real fish.

AB  - We propose a generative model for the spatio-temporal distribution of high dimensional categorical observations. These are commonly produced by robots equipped with an imaging sensor such as a camera, paired with an image classifier, potentially producing observations over thousands of categories. The proposed approach combines the use of Dirichlet distributions to model sparse co-occurrence relations between the observed categories using a latent variable, and Gaussian processes to model the latent variable's spatio-temporal distribution. Experiments in this paper show that the resulting model is able to efficiently and accurately approximate the temporal distribution of high dimensional categorical measurements such as taxonomic observations of microscopic organisms in the ocean, even in unobserved (held out) locations, far from other samples. This work's primary motivation is to enable deployment of informative path planning techniques over high dimensional categorical fields, which until now have been limited to scalar or low dimensional vector observations.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a tilting locomotion system based on a compliant tensegrity structure with multiple stable equilibrium configurations. A tensegrity structure featuring 4 stable equilibrium states is considered. The mechanical model of the structure is presented and the according equations of motion are derived. The variation of the length of selected structural members allows to influence the prestress state and the corresponding shape of the tensegrity structure. Based on bifurcation analyses a reliable actuation strategy to control the current equilibrium state is designed. In this work, the tensegrity structure is assumed to be in contact with a horizontal plane due to gravity. The derived actuation strategy is utilized to generate tilting locomotion by successively changing the equilibrium state. Numerical simulations are evaluated considering the locomotion characteristics. In order to validate this theoretical approach a prototype is developed. Experiments regarding to the equilibrium configurations, the actuation strategy and the locomotion characteristics are evaluated using image processing tools and motion capturing. The results verify the theoretical data and confirm the working principle of the investigated tilting locomotion system. This approach represents a feasible actuation strategy to realize a reliable tilting locomotion utilizing the multistability of compliant tensegrity structures.

AB  - Soft robot has demonstrated promise in unstructured and dynamic environments due to unique advantages, such as safe interaction, adaptiveness, easy to actuate, and easy fabrication. However, the highly dissipative nature of elastic materials results in small stiffness of soft robot which limits certain functions, such as force transmission, position accuracy, and load capability. In this paper, we present a novel articulated soft robot with variable stiffness. The robot is constructed by rigid joints and compliant bistable structures in series. Each joint can be independently locked through triggering the bistable structure to touch the mechanical constrain. Thus, the bending stiffness of the joint can be magnified which increases the stiffness of the articulated soft robot. Through this construction method, even driven by only one servomotor, the robot demonstrates variable workspace and stiffness which have the potential of dexterous manipulation and maintaining shape under tip load.

AB  - Soft robots apply compliant materials to perform motions and behaviors not typically achievable by rigid robots. An underwater, compliant, multi-segment continuum manipulator that can bend, swallow, disgorge is developed in this study. The manipulator is driven by McKibben water hydraulic artificial muscle (WHAM). The mechanical properties of the WHAM are tested and analyzed experimentally. The kinematics model, which concerns about the variable diameter structure of the soft grippers, are established to simulate the behaviors of the manipulator among the bending, swallowing and disgorging procedure. A mouth-tongue collaborative soft robot assembled with another single-segment soft robot arm is presented. And its functions are experimentally testified. The distinctive functions were verified according to the experimental results.

AB  - Soft robots are theoretically well-suited to rescue and exploration applications where their flexibility allows for the traversal of highly cluttered environments. However, most existing mobile soft robots are not fast or powerful enough to effectively traverse three dimensional environments. In this paper, we introduce a new mobile robot with a continuously deformable slender body structure, the SalamanderBot, which combines the flexibility and maneuverability of soft robots, with the speed and power of traditional mobile robots. It consists of a cable-driven bellows-like origami module based on the Yoshimura crease pattern mounted between sets of powered wheels. The origami structure allows the body to deform as necessary to adapt to complex environments and terrains, while the wheels allow the robot to reach speeds of up to 303.1 mm/s (2.05 body-length/s). Salamanderbot can climb up to 60-degree slopes and perform sharp turns with a minimum turning radius of 79.9 mm (0.54 body-length).

AB  - The human thumb's state contribution to grasping and dexterous manipulation of objects is a function of the kinematic multiplicity of joints and structure of the bones, joints, and ligaments. This paper looks at the design and evaluation of a human-like thumb for use in a robotic hand, where the thumb's state contribution to grasping and dexterous manipulation is a function of a simplified kinematic model based on that of the human thumb, but also on empirical trials of surgical techniques to retain functionality while reducing the number of joints in the thumb. Motion Capture Data of the End Effector is analyzed with the measured excursion of the tendons to determine the relationship between tendon velocities and task-space velocities. After validating the procedure experimentally, a simplified metric is proposed to represent this data, and shows that our prototype is predicted to have a relatively smooth mapping between tendon excursion velocity and end effector velocity.

AB  - Enabling long-term operation during day and night for collaborative robots requires a comprehensive understanding of the unstructured environment. Besides, in the dynamic environment, robots must be able to recognize dynamic objects and collaboratively build a global map. This paper proposes a novel approach for dynamic collaborative mapping based on multimodal environmental perception. For each mission, robots first apply heterogeneous sensor fusion model to detect humans and separate them to acquire static observations. Then, the collaborative mapping is performed to estimate the relative position between robots and local 3D maps are integrated into a globally consistent 3D map. The experiment is conducted in the day and night rainforest with moving people. The results show the accuracy, robustness, and versatility in 3D map fusion missions.

AB  - Travel over sloped terrain is difficult as an incline changes the interaction between each wheel and the ground resulting in an unbalanced load distribution which can lead to loss of traction and instability. This paper presents a novel approach to generating wheel rotation for primary locomotion by only changing its centre of rotation, or as a complimentary locomotion source to increase versatility of a plain centre hub drive. This is done using linear actuators within a wheel to control the position of the centre hub and induce a moment on the wheel from gravity. In doing so our platform allows for active ride height selection and individual wheel pose control. We present the system with calculations outlining the theoretical properties and perform experiments to validate the concept under loading via multiple gaits to show motion on slopes, and sustained motion over extended distance. We envision applications in conjunction to assist current motor drives and increasing slope traversability by allowing body pose and centre of gravity manipulation, or as a primary locomotion system.

AB  - This paper proposes a Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) architecture for planetary rovers targeting the conditions of upcoming Mars exploration missions such as Mars 2020 and the Sample Fetching Rover (SFR). The navigation requirements of these missions demand a control architecture featuring autonomous capabilities to achieve a fast and long traverse. The proposed solution presents a two-level architecture where the efficient navigation (lower) level is always active and the full navigation (upper) level is enabled according to the difficulty of the terrain. The first level is an efficient implementation of the basic functionalities for autonomous navigation based on hazard detection, local path replanning, and trajectory control with visual odometry. The second level implements an adaptive SLAM algorithm that improves the relative localization, evaluates the traversability of the terrain ahead for a more optimal path planning, and performs global (absolute) localization that corrects the pose drift during longer traverses. The architecture provides a solution for long-range, low supervision, and fast planetary exploration. Both navigation levels have been validated on planetary analog field test campaigns.

AB  - As the growth of smart home, healthcare, and home robot applications, learning a face recognition system which is specific for a particular environment and capable of self-adapting to the temporal changes in appearance (e.g., caused by illumination or camera position) is nowadays an important topic. In this paper, given a video of a group of people, which simulates the surveillance video in a smart home environment, we propose a novel approach which unsuper- visedly learns a face recognition model based on two main components: (1) a triplet network that extracts identity-aware feature from face images for performing face recognition by clustering, and (2) an augmentation network that is conditioned on the identity-aware features and aims at synthesizing more face samples. Particularly, the training data for the triplet network is obtained by using the spatiotemporal characteristic of face samples within a video, while the augmentation network learns to disentangle a face image into identity-aware and identity-irrelevant features thus is able to generate new faces of the same identity but with variance in appearance. With taking the richer training data produced by augmentation network, the triplet network is further fine-tuned and achieves better performance in face recognition. Extensive experiments not only show the efficacy of our model in learning an environment- specific face recognition model unsupervisedly, but also verify its adaptability to various appearance changes.

AB  - Mobile robot assistants have many applications, such as helping people in their daily living activities. These robots have to detect and recognize the actions and goals of the humans they are assisting. While there are several wide-spread plan and activity recognition solutions for controlled environments with many built-in sensors, like smart-homes, there is a lack of such systems for mobile robots operating in open settings, such as an apartment. We propose a module for the recognition of activities and goals for daily living by mobile robots, in real time and for complex activities. Our approach recognizes human-object interaction using an RGB-D camera to infer low-level actions which are sent to a goal recognition algorithm. Results show that our approach is both in real time and requires little computational resources, which facilitates its deployment on a mobile and low-cost robotics platform.

AB  - Most of the research effort on image-based place recognition is designed for urban environments. In bucolic environments such as natural scenes with low texture and little semantic content, the main challenge is to handle the variations in visual appearance across time such as illumination, weather, vegetation state or viewpoints. The nature of the variations is different and this leads to a different approach to describing a bucolic scene. We introduce a global image description computed from its semantic and topological information. It is built from the wavelet transforms of the image's semantic edges. Matching two images is then equivalent to matching their semantic edge transforms. This method reaches state-of-the-art image retrieval performance on two multi-season environment-monitoring datasets: the CMU-Seasons and the Symphony Lake dataset. It also generalizes to urban scenes on which it is on par with the current baselines NetVLAD and DELF.

AB  - The increasingly-used robotic systems can provide precise delivery and reduce X-ray radiation to medical staff in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), but natural manipulations of interventionalists are forgone in most robot-assisted procedures. Therefore, it is necessary to explore natural manipulations to design more advanced human-robot interfaces (HRI). In this study, a multilayer-multimodal fusion architecture is proposed to recognize six typical subpatterns of guidewire manipulations in conventional PCI. The synchronously acquired multimodal behaviors from ten subjects are used as the inputs of the fusion architecture. Six classification-based and two rule-based fusion algorithms are evaluated for performance comparisons. Experimental results indicate that the multimodal fusion brings significant accuracy improvement in comparison with single-modal schemes. Furthermore, the proposed architecture can achieve the overall accuracy of 96.90%, much higher than that of a singlelayer recognition architecture (92.56%). These results have indicated the potential of the proposed method for facilitating the development of HRI for robot-assisted PCI.

AB  - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the basic problems in mobile robotics. While most approaches are based on occupancy grid maps, Normal Distributions Transforms (NDT) and mixtures like Occupancy Normal Distribution Transforms (ONDT) have been shown to represent sensor measurements more accurately. In this work, we slightly re-formulate the (O)NDT matching function such that it becomes a least squares problem that can be solved with various robust numerical and analytical non-linear optimizers. Further, we propose a novel global (O)NDT scan matcher for loop closure. In our evaluation, our NDT and ONDT methods are able to outperform the occupancy grid map based ones we adopted from Google's Cartographer implementation.

AB  - Analyzing sensor data of plants and monitoring plant performance is a central element in different agricultural robotics applications. In plant science, phenotyping refers to analyzing plant traits for monitoring growth, for describing plant properties, or characterizing the plant's overall performance. It plays a critical role in the agricultural tasks and in plant breeding. Recently, there is a rising interest in using 3D data obtained from laser scanners and 3D cameras to develop automated non-intrusive techniques for estimating plant traits. In this paper, we address the problem of registering 3D point clouds of the plants over time, which is a backbone of applications interested in tracking spatio-temporal traits of individual plants. Registering plants over time is challenging due to its changing topology, anisotropic growth, and non-rigid motion in between scans. We propose a novel approach that exploits the skeletal structure of the plant and determines correspondences over time and drives the registration process. Our approach explicitly accounts for the non-rigidity and the growth of the plant over time in the registration. We tested our approach on a challenging dataset acquired over the course of two weeks and successfully registered the 3D plant point clouds recorded with a laser scanner forming a basis for developing systems for automated temporal plant-trait analysis.

AB  - We propose an uncertainty-based sensor fusion framework for visual-inertial odometry, which is the task of estimating relative motion using images and measurements from inertial measurement units. Visual-inertial odometry enables robust and scale-aware estimation of motion by incorporating sensor states, such as metric scale, velocity, and the direction of gravity, into the estimation. However, the observability of the states depends on sensor motion. For example, if the sensor moves in a constant velocity, scale and velocity cannot be observed from inertial measurements. Under these degenerate motions, existing methods may produce inaccurate results because they incorporate erroneous states estimated from non-informative inertial measurements. Our proposed framework is able to avoid this situation by adaptively switching estimation modes, which represents the states that should be incorporated, based on their uncertainties. These uncertainties can be obtained at a small computational cost by reusing the Jacobian matrices computed in bundle adjustment. Our approach consistently outperformed conventional sensor fusion in datasets with different motion characteristics, namely, the KITTI odometry dataset recorded by a ground vehicle and the EuRoC MAV dataset captured from a micro aerial vehicle.

This enables autonomous navigation and safe path planning of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a robust, real-time LOAM algorithm for LiDARs with small FoV and irregular samplings. By taking effort on both frontend and back-end, we address several fundamental challenges arising from such LiDARs, and achieve better performance in both precision and efficiency compared to existing baselines.

AB  - In this paper, we present an active SLAM framework for volumetric exploration of 3D underwater environments with multibeam sonar. Recent work in integrated SLAM and planning performs localization while maintaining volumetric free-space information. However, an absence of informative loop closures can lead to imperfect maps, and therefore unsafe behavior. To solve this, we propose a navigation policy that reduces vehicle pose uncertainty by balancing between volumetric exploration and revisitation. To identify locations to revisit, we build a 3D visual dictionary from real-world sonar data and compute a metric of submap saliency. Revisit actions are chosen based on propagated pose uncertainty and sensor information gain. Loop closures are integrated as constraints in our pose-graph SLAM formulation and these deform the global occupancy grid map. We evaluate our performance in simulation and real-world experiments, and highlight the advantages over an uncertainty-agnostic framework.

AB  - Service robots should be able to operate autonomously in dynamic and daily changing environments over an extended period of time. While Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most fundamental problems for robotic autonomy, most existing SLAM works are evaluated with data sequences that are recorded in a short period of time. In real-world deployment, there can be out-of-sight scene changes caused by both natural factors and human activities. For example, in home scenarios, most objects may be movable, replaceable or deformable, and the visual features of the same place may be significantly different in some successive days. Such out-of-sight dynamics pose great challenges to the robustness of pose estimation, and hence a robot's long-term deployment and operation. To differentiate the forementioned problem from the conventional works which are usually evaluated in a static setting in a single run, the term lifelong SLAM is used here to address SLAM problems in an ever-changing environment over a long period of time. To accelerate lifelong SLAM research, we release the OpenLORIS-Scene datasets. The data are collected in real-world indoor scenes, for multiple times in each place to include scene changes in real life. We also design benchmarking metrics for lifelong SLAM, with which the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation are evaluated separately. The datasets and benchmark are available online at lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/dataset/scene.

AB  - We propose a fast and lightweight end-to-end convolutional network architecture for real-time segmentation of high resolution videos, NfS-SegNet, that can segement 2K-videos at 36.5 FPS with 24.3 GFLOPS. This speed and computation-efficiency is due to following reasons: 1) The encoder network, NfS-Net, is optimized for speed with simple building blocks without memory-heavy operations such as depthwise convolutions, and outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight CNN architectures such as SqueezeNet [2], Mo- bileNet v1 [3] & v2 [4] and ShuffleNet v1 [5] & v2 [6] on image classification with significantly higher speed. 2) The NfS- SegNet has an asymmetric architecture with deeper encoder and shallow decoder, whose design is based on our empirical finding that the decoder is the main bottleneck in computation with relatively small contribution to the final performance. 3) Our novel uncertainty-aware knowledge distillation method guides the teacher model to focus its knowledge transfer on the most difficult image regions. We validate the performance of NfS-SegNet with the CITYSCAPE [1] benchmark, on which it achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight segementation models in terms of both accuracy and speed.

AB  - The horizon line is an important geometric feature for many image processing and scene understanding tasks in computer vision. For instance, in navigation of autonomous vehicles or driver assistance, it can be used to improve 3D reconstruction as well as for semantic interpretation of dynamic environments. While both algorithms and datasets exist for single images, the problem of horizon line estimation from video sequences has not gained attention. In this paper, we show how convolutional neural networks are able to utilise the temporal consistency imposed by video sequences in order to increase the accuracy and reduce the variance of horizon line estimates. A novel CNN architecture with an improved residual convolutional LSTM is presented for temporally consistent horizon line estimation. We propose an adaptive loss function that ensures stable training as well as accurate results. Furthermore, we introduce an extension of the KITTI dataset which contains precise horizon line labels for 43699 images across 72 video sequences. A comprehensive evaluation shows that the proposed approach consistently achieves superior performance compared with existing methods.

AB  - Deployment and operation of autonomous underwater vehicles is expensive and time-consuming. High-quality realistic sonar data simulation could be of benefit to multiple applications, including training of human operators for post-mission analysis, as well as tuning and validation of autonomous target recognition (ATR) systems for underwater vehicles. Producing realistic synthetic sonar imagery is a challenging problem as the model has to account for specific artefacts of real acoustic sensors, vehicle attitude, and a variety of environmental factors. We propose a novel method for generating realistic-looking sonar side-scans of full-length missions, called Markov Conditional pix2pix (MC-pix2pix). Quantitative assessment results confirm that the quality of the produced data is almost indistinguishable from real. Furthermore, we show that bootstrapping ATR systems with MC-pix2pix data can improve the performance. Synthetic data is generated 18 times faster than real acquisition speed, with full user control over the topography of the generated data.

AB  - Informed sampling-based planning algorithms exploit problem knowledge for better search performance. This knowledge is often expressed as heuristic estimates of solution cost and used to order the search. The practical improvement of this informed search depends on the accuracy of the heuristic. Selecting an appropriate heuristic is difficult. Heuristics applicable to an entire problem domain are often simple to define and inexpensive to evaluate but may not be beneficial for a specific problem instance. Heuristics specific to a problem instance are often difficult to define or expensive to evaluate but can make the search itself trivial. This paper presents Adaptively Informed Trees (AIT*), an almost-surely asymptotically optimal sampling-based planner based on BIT*. AIT* adapts its search to each problem instance by using an asymmetric bidirectional search to simultaneously estimate and exploit a problem-specific heuristic. This allows it to quickly find initial solutions and converge towards the optimum. AIT* solves the tested problems as fast as RRT-Connect while also converging towards the optimum.

AB  - Robotic manipulation problems are inherently continuous, but typically have underlying discrete structure, e.g., whether or not an object is grasped. This means many problems are multi-modal and in particular have a continuous infinity of modes. For example, in a pick-and-place manipulation domain, every grasp and placement of an object is a mode. Usually manipulation problems require the robot to transition into different modes, e.g., going from a mode with an object placed to another mode with the object grasped. To successfully find a manipulation plan, a planner must find a sequence of valid single-mode motions as well as valid transitions between these modes. Many manipulation planners have been proposed to solve tasks with multi-modal structure. However, these methods require mode-specific planners and fail to scale to very cluttered environments or to tasks that require long sequences of transitions. This paper presents a general layered planning approach to multi-modal planning that uses a discrete "lead" to bias search towards useful mode transitions. The difficulty of achieving specific mode transitions is captured online and used to bias search towards more promising sequences of modes. We demonstrate our planner on complex scenes and show that significant performance improvements are tied to both our discrete "lead" and our continuous representation.

AB  - State-of-the-art coverage planning methods perform well in simple environments but take an ineffectively long time to converge to an optimal solution in complex three-dimensional (3D) environments. As more structures are present in the same volume of workspace, these methods slow down as they spend more time searching for all of the nooks and crannies concealed in three-dimensional spaces. This work presents a method for coverage planning that employs a multi-resolution hierarchical framework to solve the problem at two different levels, producing much higher efficiency than the state-of-the-art. First, a high-level algorithm separates the environment into multiple subspaces at different resolutions and computes an order of the subspaces for traversal. Second, a low-level sampling-based algorithm solves for paths within the subspaces for detailed coverage. In experiments, we evaluate our method using real-world datasets from complex three-dimensional scenes. Our method finds paths that are constantly shorter and converges at least ten times faster than the state-of-the-art. Further, we show results of a physical experiment where a lightweight UAV follows the paths to realize the coverage.

AB  - The increasing popularity of quadrotors has given rise to a class of predominantly vision-driven vehicles. This paper addresses the problem of perception-aware time optimal path parametrization for quadrotors. Although many different choices of perceptual modalities are available, the low weight and power budgets of quadrotor systems makes a camera ideal for on-board navigation and estimation algorithms. However, this does come with a set of challenges. The limited field of view of the camera can restrict the visibility of salient regions in the environment, which dictates the necessity to consider perception and planning jointly. The main contribution of this paper is an efficient time optimal path parametrization algorithm for quadrotors with limited field of view constraints. We show in a simulation study that a state-of-the-art controller can track planned trajectories, and we validate the proposed algorithm on a quadrotor platform in experiments.

AB  - The safety of an autonomous vehicle not only depends on its own perception of the world around it, but also on the perception and recognition from other vehicles. If an ego vehicle considers the uncertainty other vehicles have about itself, then by reducing the estimated uncertainty it can increase its safety. In this paper, we focus on how an ego vehicle plans its trajectories through the blind spots of other vehicles. We create visibility-aware planning, where the ego vehicle chooses its trajectories such that it reduces the perceived uncertainty other vehicles may have about the state of the ego vehicle. We present simulations of traffic and highway environments, where an ego vehicle must pass another vehicle, make a lane change, or traverse a partially-occluded intersection. Emergent behavior shows that when using visibility-aware planning, the ego vehicle spends less time in a blind spot, and may slow down before entering the blind spot so as to increase the likelihood other vehicles perceive the ego vehicle.

AB  - The field of soft robotics is grounded on the idea that, due to their inherent compliance, soft robots can safely interact with the environment. Thus, the development of effective planning and control pipelines for soft robots should incorporate reliable robot-environment interaction models. This strategy enables soft robots to effectively exploit contacts to autonomously navigate and accomplish tasks in the environment. However, for a class of soft robots, namely vine-inspired, tip-extending or "vine" robots, such interaction models and the resulting planning and control strategies do not exist. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of vine robots interacting with their environment and propose an obstacle-interaction model that characterizes the bending and wrinkling deformation induced by the environment. Starting from this, we devise a novel obstacle-interaction planning method for these robots. We show how obstacle interactions can be effectively leveraged to enlarge the set of reachable workspace for the robot tip, and verify our findings with both simulated and real experiments. Our work improves the capabilities of this new class of soft robot, helping to advance the field of soft robotics.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the consensus problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of environmental constraints under a general communication topology containing a directed spanning tree. First, based on a position transformation function, we propose a novel dynamic reference position and yaw angle for each UAV to cope with both the asymmetric topology and the constraints. Then, the backstepping-like design methodology is presented to derive a local tracking controller for each UAV such that its position and yaw angle can converge to the reference ones. The proposed protocol is distributed in the sense that, the input update of each UAV dynamically relies only on local state information from its neighborhood set and the constraints, and it does not require any additional centralized information. It is demonstrated that under the proposed protocol, all UAVs reach consensus without violation of the environmental constraints. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the protocol.

AB  - In this paper, we present Neural-Swarm, a nonlinear decentralized stable controller for close-proximity flight of multirotor swarms. Close-proximity control is challenging due to the complex aerodynamic interaction effects between multirotors, such as downwash from higher vehicles to lower ones. Conventional methods often fail to properly capture these interaction effects, resulting in controllers that must maintain large safety distances between vehicles, and thus are not capable of close-proximity flight. Our approach combines a nominal dynamics model with a regularized permutation-invariant Deep Neural Network (DNN) that accurately learns the high-order multi-vehicle interactions. We design a stable nonlinear tracking controller using the learned model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller significantly outperforms a baseline nonlinear tracking controller with up to four times smaller worst-case height tracking errors. We also empirically demonstrate the ability of our learned model to generalize to larger swarm sizes.

AB  - The line coverage problem is the coverage of linear environment features (e.g., road networks, power lines), modeled as 1D segments, by one or more robots while respecting resource constraints (e.g., battery capacity, flight time) for each of the robots. The robots incur direction dependent costs and resource demands as they traverse the edges. We treat the line coverage problem as an optimization problem, with the total cost of the tours as the objective, by formulating it as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The line coverage problem is NP-hard and hence we develop a heuristic algorithm, Merge-Embed-Merge (MEM). We compare it against the optimal MILP approach and a baseline heuristic algorithm, Extended Path Scanning. We show the MEM algorithm is fast and suitable for real-time applications. To tackle large-scale problems, our approach performs graph simplification and graph partitioning, followed by robot tour generation for each of the partitioned subgraphs. We demonstrate our approach on a large graph with 4,658 edges and 4,504 vertices that represents an urban region of about 16 sq. km. We compare the performance of the algorithms on several small road networks and experimentally demonstrate the approach using UAVs on the UNC Charlotte campus road network.

AB  - This paper presents a coverage control algorithm for teams of quadcopters with downward facing visual sensors that prevents the appearance of coverage holes in-between the monitored areas while maximizing the coverage quality as much as possible. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for preventing the appearance of holes in-between the fields of views among trios of robots. Because this condition can be expressed as logically combined constraints, control nonsmooth barrier functions are implemented to enforce it. An algorithm which extends control nonsmooth barrier functions to hybrid systems is implemented to manage the switching among barrier functions caused by the changes of the robots composing trio. The performance and validity of the proposed algorithm are evaluated in simulation as well as on a team of quadcopters.

AB  - Predicting the possible future behaviors of vehicles that drive on shared roads is a crucial task for safe autonomous driving. Many existing approaches to this problem strive to distill all possible vehicle behaviors into a simplified set of high-level actions. However, these action categories do not suffice to describe the full range of maneuvers possible in the complex road networks we encounter in the real world. To combat this deficiency, we propose a new method that leverages the mapped road topology to reason over possible goals and predict the future spatial occupancy of dynamic road actors. We show that our approach is able to accurately predict future occupancy that remains consistent with the mapped lane geometry and naturally captures multi-modality based on the local scene context while also not suffering from the mode collapse problem observed in prior work.

AB  - Mobile robots capable of navigating seamlessly and safely in pedestrian rich environments promise to bring robotic assistance closer to our daily lives. In this paper we draw on insights of how humans move in crowded spaces to explore how to recognize pedestrian navigation intent, how to predict pedestrian motion and how a robot may adapt its navigation policy dynamically when facing unexpected human movements. Our approach is to develop algorithms that replicate this behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our prediction algorithm using real-world pedestrian datasets and achieve comparable or better prediction accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we show that confidence of pedestrian prediction can be used to adjust the risk of a navigation policy adaptively to afford the most comfortable level as measured by the frequency of personal space violation in comparison with baselines. Furthermore, our adaptive navigation policy is able to reduce the number of collisions by 43% in the presence of novel pedestrian motion not seen during training.

AB  - Decision-making in dense traffic scenarios is challenging for automated vehicles (AVs) due to potentially stochastic behaviors of other traffic participants and perception uncertainties (e.g., tracking noise and prediction errors, etc.). Although the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a systematic way to incorporate these uncertainties, it quickly becomes computationally intractable when scaled to the real-world large-size problem. In this paper, we present an efficient uncertainty-aware decision-making (EUDM) framework, which generates long-term lateral and longitudinal behaviors in complex driving environments in real-time. The computation complexity is controlled to an appropriate level by two novel techniques, namely, the domain-specific closed-loop policy tree (DCP-Tree) structure and conditional focused branching (CFB) mechanism. The key idea is utilizing domain-specific expert knowledge to guide the branching in both action and intention space. The proposed framework is validated using both onboard sensing data captured by a real vehicle and an interactive multi-agent simulation platform. We also release the code of our framework to accommodate benchmarking.

AB  - Autonomous urban driving navigation is still an open problem and has ample room for improvement in unknown complex environments and terrible weather conditions. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework, called IPP-RL, to handle these problems. IPP means an Imitation learning method fusing visual information with the additional steering angle calculated by Pure-Pursuit (PP) method, and RL means using Reinforcement Learning for further training. In our IPP model, the visual information captured by camera can be compensated by the calculated steering angle, thus it could perform well under bad weather conditions. However, imitation learning performance is limited by the driving data severely. Thus we use a reinforcement learning method-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-in the second stage training, which shares the learned weights from pretrained IPP model. In this way, our IPP-RL can lower the dependency of imitation learning on demonstration data and solve the problem of low exploration efficiency caused by randomly initialized weights in reinforcement learning. Moreover, we design a more reasonable reward function and use the n-step return to update the critic-network in DDPG. Our experiments on CARLA driving benchmark demonstrate that our IPP-RL is robust to lousy weather conditions and shows remarkable generalization capability in unknown environments on navigation task.

AB  - In the autonomous driving area synthetic data is crucial for cover specific traffic scenarios which autonomous vehicle must handle. This data commonly introduces domain gap between synthetic and real domains. In this paper we deploy data augmentation to generate custom traffic scenarios with VRUs in order to improve pedestrian recognition. We provide a pipeline for augmentation of the Cityscapes dataset with virtual pedestrians. In order to improve augmentation realism of the pipeline we reveal a novel generative network architecture for adversarial learning of the data-set lighting conditions. We also evaluate our approach on the tasks of semantic and instance segmentation.

AB  - We present a novel key region extraction method of point cloud, ROI-cloud, for LiDAR odometry and localization with autonomous robots. Traditional methods process massive point cloud data in every region within the field of view. In dense urban environments, however, processing redundant and dynamic regions of point cloud is time-consuming and harmful to the results of matching algorithms. In this paper, a voxelized cube set, ROI-cloud, is proposed to solve this problem by exclusively reserving the regions of interest for better point set registration and pose estimation. 3D space is firstly voxelized into weighted cubes. The key idea is to update their weights continually and extract cubes with high importance as key regions. By extracting geometrical features of a LiDAR scan, the importance of each cube is evaluated as a new measurement. With the help of on-board IMU/odometry data as well as new measurements, the weights of cubes are updated recursively through Bayes filtering. Thus, dynamic and redundant point cloud inside cubes with low importance are discarded by means of Monte Carlo sampling. Our method is validated on various datasets, and results indicate that the ROI-cloud improves the existing method in both accuracy and speed.

AB  - Visual localization is the problem of estimating a camera within a scene and a key technology for autonomous robots. State-of-the-art approaches for accurate visual localization use scene-specific representations, resulting in the overhead of constructing these models when applying the techniques to new scenes. Recently, learned approaches based on relative pose estimation have been proposed, carrying the promise of easily adapting to new scenes. However, they are currently significantly less accurate than state-of-the-art approaches. In this paper, we are interested in analyzing this behavior. To this end, we propose a novel framework for visual localization from relative poses. Using a classical feature-based approach within this framework, we show state-of-the-art performance. Replacing the classical approach with learned alternatives at various levels, we then identify the reasons for why deep learned approaches do not perform well. Based on our analysis, we make recommendations for future work.

AB  - Combining multiple complementary techniques together has long been regarded as a way to improve performance. In visual localization, multi-sensor fusion, multi-process fusion of a single sensing modality, and even combinations of different localization techniques have been shown to result in improved performance. However, merely fusing together different localization techniques does not account for the varying performance characteristics of different localization techniques. In this paper we present a novel, hierarchical localization system that explicitly benefits from three varying characteristics of localization techniques: the distribution of their localization hypotheses, their appearance- and viewpointinvariant properties, and the resulting differences in where in an environment each system works well and fails. We show how two techniques deployed hierarchically work better than in parallel fusion, how combining two different techniques works better than two levels of a single technique, even when the single technique has superior individual performance, and develop two and three-tier hierarchical structures that progressively improve localization performance. Finally, we develop a stacked hierarchical framework where localization hypotheses from techniques with complementary characteristics are concatenated at each layer, significantly improving retention of the correct hypothesis through to the final localization stage. Using two challenging datasets, we show the proposed system outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - Tracking the pose of a camera is at the core of visual localization methods used in many applications. As the observations of a camera are inherently affected by lighting, it has always been a challenge for these methods to cope with varying lighting conditions. Thus far, this issue has mainly been approached with the intent to increase robustness by choosing lighting invariant map representations. In contrast, our work aims at explicitly exploiting lighting effects for camera tracking. To achieve this, we propose a lighting adaptable map representation for indoor environments that allows real-time rendering of the scene illuminated by an arbitrary subset of the lamps contained in the model. Our method for estimating the light setting from the current camera observation enables us to adapt the model according to the lighting conditions present in the scene. As a result, lighting effects like cast shadows do no longer act as disturbances that demand robustness but rather as beneficial features when matching observations against the map. We leverage these capabilities in a direct dense camera tracking approach and demonstrate its performance in realworld experiments in scenes with varying lighting conditions.

AB  - Visual place recognition algorithms trade off three key characteristics: their storage footprint, their computational requirements, and their resultant performance, often expressed in terms of recall rate. Significant prior work has investigated highly compact place representations, sub-linear computational scaling and sub-linear storage scaling techniques, but have always involved a significant compromise in one or more of these regards, and have only been demonstrated on relatively small datasets. In this paper we present a novel place recognition system which enables for the first time the combination of ultra-compact place representations, near sub-linear storage scaling and extremely lightweight compute requirements. Our approach exploits the inherently sequential nature of much spatial data in the robotics domain and inverts the typical target criteria, through intentionally coarse scalar quantization-based hashing that leads to more collisions but is resolved by sequence-based matching. For the first time, we show how effective place recognition rates can be achieved on a new very large 10 million place dataset, requiring only 8 bytes of storage per place and 37K unitary operations to achieve over 50% recall for matching a sequence of 100 frames, where a conventional stateof-the-art approach both consumes 1300 times more compute and fails catastrophically. We present analysis investigating the effectiveness of our hashing overload approach under varying sizes of quantized vector length, comparison of near miss matches with the actual match selections and characterise the effect of variance re-scaling of data on quantization.

AB  - We address the localization of robots in a multi-MAV system where external infrastructure like GPS or motion capture systems may not be available. Our approach lends itself to implementation on platforms with several constraints on size, weight, and power (SWaP). Particularly, our framework fuses the onboard VIO with the anonymous, visual-based robot-to-robot detection to estimate all robot poses in one common frame, addressing three main challenges: 1) the initial configuration of the robot team is unknown, 2) the data association between each vision-based detection and robot targets is unknown, and 3) the vision-based detection yields false negatives, false positives, inaccurate, and provides noisy bearing, distance measurements of other robots. Our approach extends the Coupled Probabilistic Data Association Filter [1] to cope with nonlinear measurements. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over a simple VIO-based method in a simulation with the measurement models statistically modeled using the real experimental data. We also show how onboard sensing, estimation, and control can be used for formation flight.

AB  - In this paper we target the problem of transferring policies across multiple environments with different dynamics parameters and motor noise variations, by introducing a framework that decouples the processes of policy learning and system identification. Efficiently transferring learned policies to an unknown environment with changes in dynamics configurations in the presence of motor noise is very important for operating robots in the real world, and our work is a novel attempt in that direction. We introduce MANGA: Method Agnostic Neural-policy Generalization and Adaptation, that trains dynamics conditioned policies and efficiently learns to estimate the dynamics parameters of the environment given off-policy state-transition rollouts in the environment. Our scheme is agnostic to the type of training method used - both reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) strategies can be used. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experimenting with four different MuJoCo agents and comparing against previously proposed transfer baselines.

AB  - Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is being actively studied for robot navigation due to its promise of superior performance and robustness. However, most existing deep RL navigation agents are trained using fixed parameters, such as maximum velocities and weightings of reward components. Since the optimal choice of parameters depends on the use-case, it can be difficult to deploy such existing methods in a variety of real-world service scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel deep RL navigation method that can adapt its policy to a wide range of parameters and reward functions without expensive retraining. Additionally, we explore a Bayesian deep learning method to optimize these parameters that requires only a small amount of preference data. We empirically show that our method can learn diverse navigation skills and quickly adapt its policy to a given performance metric or to human preference. We also demonstrate our method in real-world scenarios.

AB  - We propose to formulate the problem of representing a distribution of robot configurations (e.g. joint angles) as that of approximating a product of experts. Our approach uses variational inference, a popular method in Bayesian computation, which has several practical advantages over sampling-based techniques. To be able to represent complex and multimodal distributions of configurations, mixture models are used as approximate distribution. We show that the problem of approximating a distribution of robot configurations while satisfying multiple objectives arises in a wide range of problems in robotics, for which the properties of the proposed approach have relevant consequences. Several applications are discussed, including learning objectives from demonstration, planning, and warm-starting inverse kinematics problems. Simulated experiments are presented with a 7-DoF Panda arm and a 28-DoF Talos humanoid.

AB  - In this study, we propose the manipulation and cell injection of a fluorescent microsensor using multiple wavelengths of light. The fluorescent microsensor is made of a 1-Î¼m polystyrene particle containing infrared (IR: 808 nm) absorbing dye and Rhodamine B. The polystyrene particle can be manipulated in water using a 1064-nm laser because the refractive index of the polystyrene is 1.6 (refractive index of water: 1.3). The IR absorbing dye absorbs 808-nm light but does not absorb the 1064-nm laser. Rhodamine B is a temperature-sensitive fluorescent dye (excitation wavelength: 488 nm, emission wavelength: 560 nm). The functions of manipulation, heating for injection, and temperature measurement are achieved by different wavelengths of 1064 nm, 808 nm, and 488 nm, respectively. The temperature increase of fluorescent microsensor with 808-nm (40 mW, 10 s) laser was approximately 15Â°C, and enough for injection of fluorescent microsensor. We demonstrated manipulation and injection of the microsensor into Madin-Darby canine kidney cell using 1064-nm and 808-nm lasers. These results confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed cell injection of a fluorescent microsensor using multiple wavelengths of light.

AB  - The Extra Robotic Legs (XRL) system is a robotic augmentation worn by a human operator consisting of two articulated robot legs that walk with the operator and help bear a heavy backpack payload. It is desirable for the Human-XRL quadruped system to walk with the rear legs lead the front by 25% of the gait period, minimizing the energy lost from foot impacts while maximizing balance stability. Unlike quadrupedal robots, the XRL cannot command the human's limbs to coordinate quadrupedal locomotion. Using a pair of Rimless Wheel models, it is shown that the systems coupled with a spring and damper converge to the desired 25% phase difference. A PoincarÃ© return map was generated using numerical simulation to examine the convergence properties to different coupler design parameters, and initial conditions. The Dynamically Coupled Double Rimless Wheel system was physically realized with a spring and dashpot chosen from the theoretical results, and initial experiments indicate that the desired synchronization properties may be achieved within several steps using this set of passive components alone.

AB  - After occasional perturbation, it is crucial to spontaneously control the limit cycle walking so that it quickly returns to its closed orbit in phase space. Otherwise, its stability can not be sufficiently guaranteed if the speed of recovery is slow while successive perturbation is applied. The accumulated deviation may eventually drive the phase outside the basin of attraction, leading to failure of the walking. In this sense, a control law that quickly recovers the disturbed phase before encountering the following perturbations is indispensable. With this consideration, here we analytically derive an optimal fast entrainment waveform that maximizes the speed of phase recovery based on phase reduction theory. Our theoretical method is numerically evaluated using a limit cycle walker, which is indirectly controlled by the oscillation of a wobbling mass via entrainment effect. The obtained waveform is used as the desired trajectory of the wobbling motion. The simulation results show that the waveform we derived achieves the best performance among all candidates. Our method helps to enhance the stability of limit cycle walking.

AB  - Correspondence identification is an essential problem for collaborative multi-robot perception, with the objective of deciding the correspondence of objects that are observed in the field of view of each robot. In this paper, we introduce a novel maximin hypergraph matching approach that formulates correspondence identification as a hypergraph matching problem. The proposed approach incorporates both spatial relationships and appearance features of objects to improve representation capabilities. It also integrates the maximin theorem to optimize the worst-case scenario in order to address distractions caused by non-covisible objects. In addition, we design an optimization algorithm to address the formulated non-convex non-continuous optimization problem. We evaluate our approach and compare it with seven previous techniques in two application scenarios, including multi-robot coordination on real robots and connected autonomous driving in simulations. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our approach in identifying object correspondence from partially overlapped views in collaborative perception, and have shown that the proposed maximin hypergraph matching approach outperforms previous techniques and obtains state-of-the-art performance.

Each sensing vehicle communicates with its neighbors to execute iterations of a Kalman filter-like update such that each agent's estimate approximates the centralized maximum a posteriori estimate without requiring the communication of measurements. We show that our method outperforms the Consensus Kalman Filter in recovering the centralized estimate given a fixed communication bandwidth. We also demonstrate the algorithm in a high fidelity urban driving simulator (CARLA), in which 50 autonomous cars connected on a time-varying communication network track the positions and velocities of 50 target vehicles using on-board cameras.

AB  - We present a novel approach to increase the flight time of a multirotor via mid-air docking and in-flight battery switching. A main quadcopter flying using a primary battery has a docking platform attached to it. A `flying battery' - a small quadcopter carrying a secondary battery - is equipped with docking legs that can mate with the main quadcopter's platform. Connectors between the legs and the platform establish electrical contact on docking, and enable power transfer from the secondary battery to the main quadcopter. A custom-designed circuit allows arbitrary switching between the primary battery and secondary battery. We demonstrate the concept in a flight experiment involving repeated docking, battery switching, and undocking. This is shown in the video attachment. The experiment increases the flight time of the main quadcopter by a factor of 4.7Ã compared to solo flight, and 2.2Ã a theoretical limit for that given multirotor. Importantly, this increase in flight time is not associated with a large increase in overall vehicle mass or size, leaving the main quadcopter in fundamentally the same safety class.

AB  - Actuator power consumption is a limiting factor in mobile robot design. In this paper we introduce the concept of an energy-recycling actuator, which uses an array of springs and clutches to capture and return elastic energy in parallel with an electric motor. Engaging and disengaging clutches appropriately could reduce electrical energy consumption without sacrificing controllability, but presents a challenging control problem. We formulated the optimal control objective of minimizing actuator power consumption as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) and solved for the global minimum. For a given actuator design and a wide range of simulated torque and rotation patterns, all corresponding to zero net work over one cycle, we compared optimized actuator energy consumption to that of an optimized gear motor with simple parallel elasticity. The simulated energy-recycling actuator consumed less electrical energy: 57% less on average and 80% less in the best case. These results demonstrate an effective approach to optimal control of this type of system, and suggest that energy-recycling actuators could substantially reduce power consumption in some robotics applications.

AB  - Even though mobile robots have been around for decades, trajectory optimization and continuous time collision avoidance remain subject of active research. Existing methods trade off between path quality, computational complexity, and kinodynamic feasibility. This work approaches the problem using a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework, that is based on a novel convex inner approximation of the collision avoidance constraint. The proposed Convex Inner ApprOximation (CIAO) method finds kinodynamically feasible and continuous time collision free trajectories, in few iterations, typically one. For a feasible initialization, the approach is guaranteed to find a feasible solution, i.e. it preserves feasibility. Our experimental evaluation shows that CIAO outperforms state of the art baselines in terms of planning efficiency and path quality. Experiments show that it also efficiently scales to high-dimensional systems. Furthermore real-world experiments demonstrate its capability of unifying trajectory optimization and tracking for safe motion planning in dynamic environments.

AB  - This paper introduces Action Image, a new grasp proposal representation that allows learning an end-to-end deep-grasping policy. Our model achieves 84% grasp success on 172 real world objects while being trained only in simulation on 48 objects with just naive domain randomization. Similar to computer vision problems, such as object detection, Action Image builds on the idea that object features are invariant to translation in image space. Therefore, grasp quality is invariant when evaluating the object-gripper relationship; a successful grasp for an object depends on its local context, but is independent of the surrounding environment. Action Image represents a grasp proposal as an image and uses a deep convolutional network to infer grasp quality. We show that by using an Action Image representation, trained networks are able to extract local, salient features of grasping tasks that generalize across different objects and environments. We show that this representation works on a variety of inputs, including color images (RGB), depth images (D), and combined color-depth (RGB-D). Our experimental results demonstrate that networks utilizing an Action Image representation exhibit strong domain transfer between training on simulated data and inference on real-world sensor streams. Finally, our experiments show that a network trained with Action Image improves grasp success (84% vs. 53%) over a baseline model with the same structure, but using actions encoded as vectors.

AB  - Learning-based grasp pose detection algorithms have boosted the performance of robot grasping, but they usually need manually fine-tuning steps to find the balance between detection accuracy and efficient. In this paper, we discard these intermediate procedures, like sampling grasps and generating grasp proposals, and propose an end-to-end grasp pose detection model. Our model uses the RGB image as the input and predicts the single grasp pose in each small grid of the image. Furthermore, the best grasps are found by non-maximum suppression (NMS) strategy. The clustering and ranking procedures are left for NMS while the network only generates dense grasp predictions, which keeps the network simple and efficient. To achieve dense predictions, the predicted grasps of our detection model are represented by the 6 channels images with each pixel location representing a rated grasp. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first neural network that attaches a grasp pose in pixel level. The model achieves 96.5% accuracy which costs 14ms for prediction of a 480Ã360 resolution RGB image in Cornell Grasp Dataset, and 90.4% robot grasping success rate for unknown objects with a parallel plate gripper in the real environment.

AB  - Grasping in cluttered scenes is challenging for robot vision systems, as detection accuracy can be hindered by partial occlusion of objects. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and 3D vision architectures to search for feasible viewpoints for grasping by the use of hand-mounted RGB-D cameras. To overcome the disadvantages of photo-realistic environment simulation, we propose a large-scale dataset called Real Embodied Dataset (RED), which includes full-viewpoint real samples on the upper hemisphere with amodal annotation and enables a simulator that has real visual feedback. Based on this dataset, a practical 3-stage transferable active grasping pipeline is developed, that is adaptive to unseen clutter scenes. In our pipeline, we propose a novel mask-guided reward to overcome the sparse reward issue in grasping and ensure category-irrelevant behavior. The grasping pipeline and its possible variants are evaluated with extensive experiments both in simulation and on a real-world UR-5 robotic arm.

AB  - Grasping for novel objects is important for robot manipulation in unstructured environments. Most of current works require a grasp sampling process to obtain grasp candidates, combined with local feature extractor using deep learning. This pipeline is time-costly, expecially when grasp points are sparse such as at the edge of a bowl.In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach to directly predict the poses, categories and scores (qualities) of all the grasps. It takes the whole sparse point clouds as the input and requires no sampling or search process. Moreover, to generate training data of multi-object scene, we propose a fast multi-object grasp detection algorithm based on Ferrari Canny metrics. A single-object dataset (79 objects from YCB object set, 23.7k grasps) and a multi-object dataset (20k point clouds with annotations and masks) are generated. A PointNet++ based network combined with multi-mask loss is introduced to deal with different training points. The whole weight size of our network is only about 11.6M, which takes about 102ms for a whole prediction process using a GeForce 840M GPU. Our experiment shows our work get 71.43% success rate and 91.60% completion rate, which performs better than current state-of-art works.

AB  - Transparent objects are a common part of everyday life, yet they possess unique visual properties that make them incredibly difficult for standard 3D sensors to produce accurate depth estimates for. In many cases, they often appear as noisy or distorted approximations of the surfaces that lie behind them. To address these challenges, we present ClearGrasp - a deep learning approach for estimating accurate 3D geometry of transparent objects from a single RGB-D image for robotic manipulation. Given a single RGB-D image of transparent objects, ClearGrasp uses deep convolutional networks to infer surface normals, masks of transparent surfaces, and occlusion boundaries. It then uses these outputs to refine the initial depth estimates for all transparent surfaces in the scene. To train and test ClearGrasp, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 50,000 RGB-D images, as well as a real-world test benchmark with 286 RGB-D images of transparent objects and their ground truth geometries. The experiments demonstrate that ClearGrasp is substantially better than monocular depth estimation baselines and is capable of generalizing to real-world images and novel objects. We also demonstrate that ClearGrasp can be applied out-of-the-box to improve grasping algorithms' performance on transparent objects. Code, data, and benchmarks will be released.

AB  - This paper addresses the task of estimating the 6 degrees of freedom pose of a known 3D object from depth information represented by a point cloud. Deep features learned by convolutional neural networks from color information have been the dominant features to be used for inferring object poses, while depth information receives much less attention. However, depth information contains rich geometric information of the object shape, which is important for inferring the object pose. We use depth information represented by point clouds as the input to both deep networks and geometry-based pose refinement and use separate networks for rotation and translation regression. We argue that the axis-angle representation is a suitable rotation representation for deep learning, and use a geodesic loss function for rotation regression. Ablation studies show that these design choices outperform alternatives such as the quaternion representation and L2 loss, or regressing translation and rotation with the same network. Our simple yet effective approach clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the YCB-video dataset.

AB  - While a great variety of 3D cameras have been introduced in recent years, most publicly available datasets for object recognition and pose estimation focus on one single camera. In this work, we present a dataset of 32 scenes that have been captured by 7 different 3D cameras, totaling 49,294 frames. This allows evaluating the sensitivity of pose estimation algorithms to the specifics of the used camera and the development of more robust algorithms that are more independent of the camera model. Vice versa, our dataset enables researchers to perform a quantitative comparison of the data from several different cameras and depth sensing technologies and evaluate their algorithms before selecting a camera for their specific task. The scenes in our dataset contain 20 different objects from the common benchmark YCB object and model set [1], [2]. We provide full ground truth 6DoF poses for each object, per-pixel segmentation, 2D and 3D bounding boxes and a measure of the amount of occlusion of each object. We have also performed an initial evaluation of the cameras using our dataset on a state-of-the-art object recognition and pose estimation system [3].

AB  - To teach robots skills, it is crucial to obtain data with supervision. Since annotating real world data is time-consuming and expensive, enabling robots to learn in a self- supervised way is important. In this work, we introduce a robot system for self-supervised 6D object pose estimation. Starting from modules trained in simulation, our system is able to label real world images with accurate 6D object poses for self-supervised learning. In addition, the robot interacts with objects in the environment to change the object configuration by grasping or pushing objects. In this way, our system is able to continuously collect data and improve its pose estimation modules. We show that the self-supervised learning improves object segmentation and 6D pose estimation performance, and consequently enables the system to grasp objects more reliably.

AB  - GelSight sensor has been used to study microgeometry of objects since 2009 in tactile sensing applications. Elastomer, reflective coating, lighting, and camera were the main challenges of making a GelSight sensor within a short period. The recent addition of permanent markers to the GelSight was a new era in shear/slip studies. In our previous studies, we introduced Ultraviolet (UV) ink and UV LEDs as a new form of marker and lighting respectively. UV ink markers are invisible using ordinary LED but can be made visible using UV LED. Currently, recognition of objects or surface textures using GelSight sensor is done using fusion of camera-only images and GelSight captured images with permanent markings. Those images are fed to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify objects. However, our novel approach in using low-cost GelSight sensor with UV markings, the 3D height map to 2D image conversion, and the additional non-Gelsight captured images for training the CNN can be eliminated. AlexNet and optical flow algorithm have been used for feature recognition of five coins without UV markings and shear/slip of the coin in GelSight with UV markings respectively. Our results on confusion matrix show that, on average coin recognition can reach 93.4% without UV markings using AlexNet. Therefore, our novel method of using GelSight with UV markings would be useful to recognize full/partial object, shear/slip, and force applied to the objects without any 3D image reconstruction.

AB  - Individuals living with paralysis or amputation can operate robotic prostheses using input signals based on their intent or attempt to move. Because sensory function is lost or diminished in these individuals, haptic feedback must be non-collocated. The intracortical brain computer interface (iBCI) has enabled a variety of neural prostheses for people with paralysis. An important attribute of the iBCI is that its input signal contains signal-independent noise. To understand the effects of signal-independent noise on a system with non-collocated haptic feedback and inform iBCI-based prostheses control strategies, we conducted an experiment with a conventional haptic interface as a proxy for the iBCI. Ablebodied users were tasked with locating an indentation within a virtual environment using input from their right hand. Non-collocated haptic feedback of the interaction forces in the virtual environment was augmented with noise of three different magnitudes and simultaneously rendered on users' left hands. We found increases in distance error of the guess of the indentation location, mean time per trial, mean peak absolute displacement and speed of tool movements during localization for the highest noise level compared to the other two levels. The findings suggest that users have a threshold of disturbance rejection and that they attempt to increase their signal-to-noise ratio through their exploratory actions.

AB  - The ocean is a harsh and unstructured environment for robotic systems; high ambient pressures, saltwater corrosion and low-light conditions demand machines with robust electrical and mechanical parts that are able to sense and respond to the environment. Prior work shows that the addition of gentle suction flow to the hands of underwater robots can aid in the handling of objects during mobile manipulation tasks. The current paper explores using this suction flow mechanism as a new modality for tactile sensing; by monitoring orifice occlusion we can get a sense of how objects make contact in the hand. The electronics required for this sensor can be located remotely from the hand and the signal is insensitive to large changes in ambient pressure associated with diving depth. In this study, suction is applied to the fingertips of a two-fingered compliant gripper and suction-based tactile sensing is monitored while an object is pulled out of a pinch grasp. As a proof of concept, a recurrent neural network model was trained to predict external force trends using only the suction signals. This tactile sensing modality holds the potential to enable automated robotic behaviors or to provide operators of remotely operated vehicles with additional feedback in a robust fashion suitable for ocean deployment.

AB  - We revise, improve and extend the system previously introduced by us and named SSM-VPR (Semantic and Spatial Matching Visual Place Recognition), largely boosting its performance above the current state of the art. The system encodes images of places by employing the activations of different layers of a pre-trained, off-the-shelf, VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It consists of two stages: given a query image of a place, (1) a list of candidates is selected from a database of places and (2) the candidates are geometrically compared with the query. The comparison is made by matching CNN features and, equally important, their spatial locations, selecting the best candidate as the recognized place. The performance of the system is maximized by finding optimal image resolutions during the second stage and by exploiting temporal correlation between consecutive frames in the employed datasets.

AB  - Autonomous robots require online trajectory planning capability to operate in the real world. Efficient offline trajectory planning methods already exist, but are computationally demanding, preventing their use online. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called Guided Trajectory Learning that learns a function approximation of solutions computed through trajectory optimization while ensuring accurate and reliable predictions. This function approximation is then used online to generate trajectories. This algorithm is designed to be easy to implement, and practical since it does not require massive computing power. It is readily applicable to any robotics systems and effortless to set up on real hardware since robust control strategies are usually already available. We demonstrate the computational performance of our algorithm on flat-foot walking with the self-balanced exoskeleton Atalante.

AB  - In this paper, we outline an interleaved acting and planning technique to rapidly reduce the uncertainty of the estimated robot's pose by perceiving relevant information from the environment, as recognizing an object or asking someone for a direction. Generally, existing localization approaches rely on low-level geometric features such as points, lines, and planes. While these approaches provide the desired accuracy, they may require time to converge, especially with incorrect initial guesses. In our approach, a task planner computes a sequence of action and perception tasks to actively obtain relevant information from the robot's perception system. We validate our approach in large state spaces, to show how the approach scales, and in real environments, to show the applicability of our method on real robots. We prove that our approach is sound, probabilistically complete, and tractable in practical cases.

AB  - In multi-agent collaborative search missions, task allocation is required to determine which agents will perform which tasks. We propose a new approach for decentralized task allocation based on a decentralized genetic algorithm (GA). The approach parallelizes a genetic algorithm across the team of agents, making efficient use of their computational resources. In the proposed approach, the agents continuously search for and share better solutions during task execution. We conducted simulation experiments to compare the decentralized GA approach and several existing approaches. Two objectives were considered: a min-sum objective (minimizing the total distance traveled by all agents) and a min-time objective (minimizing the time to visit all locations of interest). The results showed that the decentralized GA approach yielded task allocations that were better on the min-time objective than those created by existing approaches and solutions that were reasonable on the min-sum objective. The decentralized GA improved min-time performance by an average of 5.6% on the larger instances. The results indicate that decentralized evolutionary approaches have a strong potential for solving the decentralized task allocation problem.

AB  - This paper presents a task and motion planning (TAMP) framework for a robotic manipulator in order to retrieve a target object from clutter. We consider a configuration of objects in a confined space with a high density so no collision-free path to the target exists. The robot must relocate some objects to retrieve the target without collisions. For fast completion of object rearrangement, the robot aims to optimize the number of pick-and-place actions which often determines the efficiency of a TAMP framework.We propose a task planner incorporating motion planning to generate executable plans which aims to minimize the number of pick-and-place actions. In addition to fully known and static environments, our method can deal with uncertain and dynamic situations incurred by occluded views. Our method is shown to reduce the number of pick-and-place actions compared to baseline methods (e.g., at least 28.0% of reduction in a known static environment with 20 objects).

AB  - This paper presents scalable designs and fabrication, actuation, and manipulation techniques for soft millirobots under uniform magnetic field control. The millirobots were fabricated through an economic and robust moulding technique using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filaments, and 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) rings. The soft millirobots were simple hollow rod-like structures with different configurations of embedded permanent magnets inside of their soft-body or at their ends. The soft-robots were actuated using six different motion modes including: pivot walking, rolling, tumbling, side-tapping, wiggling, and wavy-motion under an external uniform magnetic field control system. The velocities of the millirobots under different motion modes were analyzed under varying magnetic flux densities (B). Moreover, deformation of the soft-robotic body in response to the magnetic field strength was measured and a deflection curve showing bending angle (Ï) was produced. Soft millirobots were navigated through a maze using a combination of the available motion modes. Different arrangements of the embedded permanent magnets enabled individual soft millirobots to respond heterogeneously under the same magnetic field inputs towards performing assembly and disassembly operation as modular subunits. Overall, this soft millirobot platform shows enormous potential for minimally invasive in vivo applications.

AB  - In reinforcement learning (RL), sparse rewards are a natural way to specify the task to be learned. However, most RL algorithms struggle to learn in this setting since the learning signal is mostly zeros. In contrast, humans are good at assessing and predicting the future consequences of actions and can serve as good reward/policy shapers to accelerate the robot learning process. Previous works have shown that the human brain generates an error-related signal, measurable using electroencephelography (EEG), when the human perceives the task being done erroneously. In this work, we propose a method that uses evaluative feedback obtained from human brain signals measured via scalp EEG to accelerate RL for robotic agents in sparse reward settings. As the robot learns the task, the EEG of a human observer watching the robot attempts is recorded and decoded into noisy error feedback signal. From this feedback, we use supervised learning to obtain a policy that subsequently augments the behavior policy and guides exploration in the early stages of RL. This bootstraps the RL learning process to enable learning from sparse reward. Using a simple robotic navigation task as a test bed, we show that our method achieves a stable obstacle-avoidance policy with high success rate, outperforming learning from sparse rewards only that struggles to achieve obstacle avoidance behavior or fails to advance to the goal.

AB  - This study aim to confirm the effect of viscosity characteristics differences on the rotational manipulation of a cylindrical rotary controller with the index finger and thumb through a quantitative analysis and evaluation of muscle and brain activations. The target motion was a rotary manipulation with the index finger and thumb of a cylindrical rotary controller with a 50 mm diameter. The rotary motion of the controller produces a click sensation at every 12 degrees in the rotation. The experimental conditions were three conditions with different viscosity characteristics related to the rotary motion of the controller. The subjects were six right-handed healthy males with a mean age of 21.7 (S. D.: 1.03) years. We analyzed the brain activity from a near- infrared spectroscopy measurement system, the muscles activity using a surface myoelectric potential measurement device, the force data at the index finger and thumb tip using two independent six-axis force/torque sensors, and the position data using a 3D position measurement device. The experimental results showed that there was no significant difference in the questionnaire survey, muscle activity, and grasping force, respectively; however, a significant difference in brain activity was observed with increased controller viscosity. Therefore, it became clear that there was a change in the brain activity when rotating the cylindrical rotary controller with the viscosity characteristics related to the rotary motion.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a real-time human-robot interface (HRI) system, where Electrooculography (EOG) and Electromyography (EMG) signals were decoded to perform reach-to-grasp movements. For that, five different eye movements (up, down, left, right and rest) were classified in real-time and translated into commands to steer an industrial robot (UR-10) to one of the four approximate target directions. Thereafter, EMG signals were decoded to perform the grasping task using an attached gripper to the UR-10 robot arm. The proposed system was tested offline on three different healthy subjects, and mean validation accuracy of 93.62% and 99.50% were obtained across the three subjects for EOG and EMG decoding, respectively. Furthermore, the system was successfully tested in real-time with one subject, and mean online accuracy of 91.66% and 100% were achieved for EOG and EMG decoding, respectively. Our results obtained by combining real-time decoding of EOG and EMG signals for robot control show overall the potential of this approach to develop powerful and less complex HRI systems. Overall, this work provides a proof-of-concept for successful real-time control of robot arms using EMG and EOG signals, paving the way for the development of more dexterous and human-controlled assistive devices.

AB  - We develop a decoding technique that estimates both the position and torque of a joint of the limb in interaction with an environment based on activities of the agonist-antagonist pair of muscles using electromyography in real time. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed as the core processor of the proposed technique that is capable of learning time series of a long-time span with varying time lags. A validation that is conducted on the wrist joint shows that the decoding approach provides an agreement of greater than 95% in kinetics (i.e. torque) estimation and an agreement of greater than 85% in kinematics (i.e. angle) estimation, between the actual and estimated variables, during interactions with an environment. Also demonstrated is the fact that the proposed decoding method inherits the strengths of the LSTM network in terms of the capability of learning EMG signals and the corresponding responses with time dependency.

AB  - Electromyography (EMG) based interfaces have been used in various robotics studies ranging from teleoperation and telemanipulation applications to the EMG based control of prosthetic, assistive, or robotic rehabilitation devices. But most of these studies have focused on the decoding of user's motion or on the control of the robotic devices in the execution of simple tasks (e.g., grasping tasks). In this work, we present a learning scheme that employs High Density Electromyography (HD-EMG) sensors to decode a set of dexterous, in-hand manipulation motions (in the object space) based on the myoelectric activations of human forearm and hand muscles. To do that, the subjects were asked to perform roll, pitch, and yaw motions manipulating two different cubes. The first cube was designed to have a center of mass coinciding with the geometric center of the cube, while for the second cube the center of mass was shifted 14 mm to the right (off-centered design). Regarding the acquisition of the myoelectric data, custom HD-EMG electrode arrays were designed and fabricated. Using these arrays, a total of 89 EMG signals were extracted. The object motion decoding was formulated as a regression problem using the Random Forests (RF) technique and the muscle importances were studied using the inherent feature variables importance calculation procedure of the RF. The muscle importance results show that different subjects use different strategies to execute the same motions on same object when the weight is off-centered. Finally, the decoded motions were used to control a five fingered robotic hand in a proof-of-concept application.

AB  - Telepresence tele-action robots enable human workers to reliably perform difficult tasks in remote, cluttered, and human environments. However, the effort to control coordinated manipulation and active perception motions may exhaust and intimidate novice workers. We hypothesize that such cognitive efforts would be effectively reduced if the teleoperators are provided with autonomous camera selection and control aligned with the natural perception-action coupling of the human motor system. Thus, we conducted a user study to investigate the coordination of active perception control and manipulation motions performed with visual feedback from various wearable and standalone cameras in a telepresence scenario. Our study discovered rich information about telepresence camera selection to inform telepresence system configuration and possible teleoperation assistance design for reduced cognitive effort in robot teleoperation.

AB  - The need for users' safety and technology accept-ability has incredibly increased with the deployment of co-bots physically interacting with humans in industrial settings, and for people assistance. A well-studied approach to meet these requirements is to ensure human-like robot motions. Classic solutions for anthropomorphic movement generation usually rely on optimization procedures, which build upon hypotheses devised from neuroscientific literature, or capitalize on learning methods. However, these approaches come with limitations, e.g. limited motion variability or the need for high dimensional datasets. In this work, we present a technique to directly embed human upper limb principal motion modes computed through functional analysis in the robot trajectory optimization. We report on the implementation with manipulators with redundant anthropomorphic kinematic architectures - although dissimilar with respect to the human model used for functional mode extraction - via Cartesian impedance control. In our experiments, we show how human trajectories mapped onto a robotic manipulator still exhibit the main characteristics of human-likeness, e.g. low jerk values. We discuss the results with respect to the state of the art, and their implications for advanced human-robot interaction in industrial co-botics and for human assistance.

AB  - Human-multi-robot collaboration is becoming more and more common in intelligent manufacturing. Optimal assembly scheduling of such systems plays a critical role in their production efficiency. Existing approaches mostly consider humans as agents with assumed or known capabilities, which leads to suboptimal performance in realistic applications where human capabilities usually change. In addition, most robot adaptation focuses on human-single-robot interaction and the adaptation in human-multi-robot interaction with changing human capability still remains challenging due to the complexity of the heterogeneous multi-agent interactions. This paper proposes a real-time adaptive assembly scheduling approach for human-multi-robot collaboration by modeling and incorporating changing human capability. A genetic algorithm is also designed to derive implementable solutions for the formulated adaptive assembly scheduling problem. The proposed approaches are validated through different simulated human-multi-robot assembly tasks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches.

AB  - Clear Corneal Incision, a challenging step in cataract surgery, and important to the overall quality of the surgery. New surgeons usually spend one full year trying to perfect their incision, but even after such rigorous training deficient incisions can still occur. This paper proposes an autonomous robotic system for this self-sealing incision. A conventional ophthalmic microscope system with a monocular camera is utilized to capture the surgical scene, ascertain the robot's position, and estimate depth information. Kinematics with a remote centre of motion (RCM) is designed for a multi-axes robot to perform the incision route. The experimental results on ex-vivo porcine eyes show the autonomous Clear Corneal Incision has a stricter three-plane structure than a surgeon-made incision, which is closer to the ideal incision.

The originality of this mechanism is its ability to be reconfigured and its capacity to perform a decoupled modulation of its stiffness in an asynchronous way. To do so, an analytical stiffness model of the robot is established, and a control methodology is proposed. A prototype of the robot is developed and assessed experimentally. The position tracking is evaluated using a 6-DOF magnetic tracker sensor showing a root mean square error less than 0.8Â° in both directions of the needle guide.

AB  - This paper introduces a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for fully-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots. The main advantage of the proposed scheme lies in its ability to explicitly handle cable tension limits. Indeed, the cable tension distribution is performed as an integral part of the main control architecture. This characteristic significantly improves the safety of the system. Experimental results demonstrate this advantage addressing a typical pick-and-place task with two different scenarios: nominal cable tension limits and reduced maximum tension. Satisfactory tracking errors were obtained in the first scenario. In the second scenario, the desired trajectory escapes from the workspace defined by the new set of tension limits. The proposed MPC scheme is able to minimize the tracking errors without violating the tension limits. Satisfying results were also obtained regarding robustness against uncertainties on the payload mass.

AB  - Tendon actuated multisection continuum arms have high potential for inspection applications in highly constrained spaces. They generate motion by axial and bending deformations. However, because of the high mechanical coupling between continuum sections, variable length-based kinematic models produce poor results. A new mechanics model for tendon actuated multisection continuum arms is proposed in this paper. The model combines the continuum arm curve parameter kinematics and concentric tube kinematics to correctly account for the large axial and bending deformations observed in the robot. Also, the model is computationally efficient and utilizes tendon tensions as the joint space variables thus eliminating the actuator length related problems such as slack and backlash. A recursive generalization of the model is also presented. Despite the high coupling between continuum sections, numerical results show that the model can be used for generating correct forward and inverse kinematic results. The model is then tested on a thin and long multisection continuum arm. The results show that the model can be used to successfully model the deformation.

AB  - This paper presents a trajectory optimization formulation for planning dynamic trajectories of a six-degree-of-freedom (six-DOF) cable-suspended parallel robot (CSPR) that extend beyond the static workspace. The optimization is guided by low-dimensional dynamic models to overcome the local minima and accelerate the exploration of the narrow feasible state space. The dynamic similarity between the six-DOF CSPR and the three-DOF point-mass CSPR is discussed with the analyses of their feasible force polyhedra. Finally, the transition trajectories of a three-DOF CSPR are used as the initial guess of the translational part of the six-DOF motion. With the proposed approach, highly dynamic motions for a six-DOF CSPR are efficiently generated with multiple oscillations. The feasibility is demonstrated by point-to-point and periodic trajectories in the physics simulation.

AB  - This study proposes an intelligent spraying system with semantic segmentation of fruit trees in a pear orchard. A fruit tree detection system was developed using the SegNet model, a semantic segmentation structure. The system is trained with images categorized into five distinct classes. The learned deep learning model performed with an accuracy of 83.79%. Further, we fusion depth data from an RGB-D camera to prevent the tree in the background from being detected. To operate the nozzles, each image captured from the camera is separated lengthwise into quarters and mapped to the nozzles. Then, the nozzle was opened when the area of fruit trees in each zone exceeded 20%. Two types of field experiments were performed in a pear orchard to verify the effectiveness of our system. From the results obtained, we can confirm the satisfactory performance of our deep learning-based intelligent spraying system. It is expected that the introduction of this system to actual farms will signicantly reduce the amount of pesticide used and will make the work environment safer for farmers.

AB  - Dormant pruning is a major cost component of fresh market tree fruit production, nearly equal in scale to harvesting the fruit. However, relatively little focus has been given to the problem of pruning trees autonomously. In this paper, we introduce a robotic system consisting of an industrial manipulator, an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera configuration, and a custom pneumatic cutter. The system is capable of planning and executing a sequence of cuts while making minimal assumptions about the environment. We leverage a novel planning framework designed for high-throughput operation which builds upon previous work to reduce motion planning time and sequence cut points intelligently. In end-to-end experiments with a set of ten different branch configurations, the system achieved a high success rate in plan execution and a 1.5x speedup in throughput versus a baseline planner, representing a significant step towards the goal of practical implementation of robotic pruning.

AB  - Progress in autonomous mobile robotics has seen significant advances in the development of many algorithms for motion control and path planning. However, robust performance from these algorithms can often only be expected if the parameters controlling them are tuned specifically for the respective robot model, and optimised for specific scenarios in the environment the robot is working in. Such parameter tuning can, depending on the underlying algorithm, amount to a substantial combinatorial challenge, often rendering extensive manual tuning of these parameters intractable. In this paper, we present a framework that permits the use of different navigation actions and/or parameters depending on the spatial context of the navigation task. We consider the respective navigation algorithms themselves mostly as a "black box", and find suitable parameters by means of an iterative optimisation, improving for performance metrics in simulated environments. We present a genetic algorithm incorporated into the framework, and empirically show that the resulting parameter sets lead to substantial performance improvements in both simulated and real-world environments in the domain of agricultural robots.

AB  - Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) have recently been introduced as a way to specify second-order motion policies defined on robot task spaces. RMP-based approaches have the advantage of being more general than traditional approaches based on operational space control; for example, the generalized task inertia in an RMP can be fully state-dependent, which is particularly effective in designing collision avoidance bahaviors. But until now RMPs have been applied only to fully actuated systems, i.e. systems for which each degree of freedom (DoF) can be directly actuated by a control input. In this paper, we present a method that extends the RMP formalism to a class of underacutated systems whose dynamics are amenable to a decomposition into a fully-actuated subsystem and a residual dynamics. We show the efficacy of the approach by constructing a suitable decomposition for a Wheeled-Inverted-Pendulum (WIP) humanoid robot and applying our method to derive motion policies for combined locomotion and manipulation tasks. Simulation results are presented for a 7-DoF system with one degree of underactuation.

AB  - Mechanical self-stability is often useful for controlling systems in uncertain and unstructured environments because it can regulate processes without explicit state observation or feedback computation. However, the performance of such systems is often not optimised, which begs the question how their dynamics can be naturally augmented by a control law to improve performance metrics. We propose a minimalistic approach to controlling mechanically self-stabilising systems by utilising model-based, feedforward bang-bang control at a global level and self-stabilizing dynamics at a local level. We demonstrate the approach in the height control problem of a sphere hovering in a vertical air jet - the so-called Bernoulli Ball. After developing a model to study the system and theoretically proving global asymptotic stability, we present the augmented controller and show how to enhance performance measures and plan behaviour. Our physical experiments show that the proposed control approach has a reduced time-to-target compared to the uncontrolled system without loss of stability (ranging from a 2.4 to 4.4 fold improvement) and that we can plan sequences of target positions at will.

AB  - Motion control of underactuated systems through the inverse dynamics contains configuration singularities. These limitations in configuration space mainly stem from the inertial coupling that passive joints/bodies create. In this study, we present a model that is free from singularity while the trajectory of the rotating mass has a small-amplitude sine wave around its circle. First, we derive the modified non-linear dynamics for a rolling system. Also, the singularity regions for this underactuated system is demonstrated. Then, the wave parameters are designed under certain conditions to remove the coupling singularities. We obtain these conditions from the positive definiteness of the inertia matrix in the inverse dynamics. Finally, the simulation results are confirmed by using a prescribed Beta function on the specified states of the rolling carrier. Because our algebraic method is integrated into the non-linear dynamics, the proposed solution has a great potential to be extended to the Lagrangian mechanics with multiple degrees-of-freedom.

AB  - Capturing large objects of unknown shape and orientation remains a challenge for most robotic grippers. We present a highly under-actuated gripper well suited for this task. Prior work shows two primary limitations to these grippers: the grip force of each link tends to decrease as the number of links increases, and the stability of an under-actuated linkage depends on the configuration of the links so grippers with many links are unlikely to be stable for arbitrary surfaces. We address these concerns by implementing two complementary methods of stabilization: using high-friction materials and scaling forces into the surface. We show that gecko-inspired adhesives provide an adhesion-controlled friction that can stabilize the gripper and improve grasp performance without the need of large normal forces. The under-actuated linkages also conform around arbitrary shapes and provide capability beyond prior adhesion-based grippers. With these high-friction interfaces, we show highly under-actuated linkages successfully grasp in many configurations without strict stability. The gripper is capable of holding over 30 N and consists of two tendon driven linkages that are each 65 cm long. This type of gripper is well suited for tasks without a predefined target geometry or orientation such as satellite servicing.

AB  - Autonomous driving in an unregulated urban crowd is an outstanding challenge, especially, in the presence of many aggressive, high-speed traffic participants. This paper presents SUMMIT, a high-fidelity simulator that facilitates the development and testing of crowd-driving algorithms. By leveraging the open-source OpenStreetMap map database and a heterogeneous multi-agent motion prediction model developed in our earlier work, SUMMIT simulates dense, unregulated urban traffic for heterogeneous agents at any worldwide locations that OpenStreetMap supports. SUMMIT is built as an extension of CARLA and inherits from it the physics and visual realism for autonomous driving simulation. SUMMIT supports a wide range of applications, including perception, vehicle control and planning, and end-to-end learning. We provide a context-aware planner together with benchmark scenarios and show that SUMMIT generates complex, realistic traffic behaviors in challenging crowd-driving settings.

AB  - Robotic Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) utilizes a robot arm as a motion system to build 3D metallic objects by depositing weld beads one above the other in a layer by layer fashion. A key part of this approach is the process study and control of Multi-Layer Multi-Bead (MLMB) deposition, which is very sensitive to process parameters and prone to error stacking. Despite its importance, it has been receiving less attention than its single bead counterpart in literature, probably due to the higher experimental overhead and complexity of modeling. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated learning-correction framework, adapted from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, to iteratively learn the direct effect of process parameters on MLMB print while simultaneously correct for any inter-layer geometric digression such that the final output is still satisfactory. The advantage is that this learning architecture can be used in conjunction with actual parts printing (hence, in-situ study), thus minimizing the required training time and material wastage. The proposed learning framework is implemented on an actual robotic WAAM system and experimentally evaluated.

AB  - The most widely used methods for toolpath planning in 3D printing slice the input model into successive 2D layers to construct the toolpath. Unfortunately the methods can incur a substantial amount of wasted motion (i.e., the extruder is moving while not printing). In recent years we have introduced a new paradigm that characterizes the space of feasible toolpaths using a dependency graph on the input model, along with several algorithms that optimize objective functions (wasted motion or print time). A natural question that arises is, under what circumstances can we efficiently compute an optimal toolpath? In this paper, we give an algorithm for computing fused deposition modeling (FDM) toolpaths that utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a powerful generalpurpose method for navigating large search spaces that is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution. Under reasonable assumptions on printer geometry that allow us to compress the dependency graph, our MCTS-based algorithm converges to find the optimal toolpath. We validate our algorithm on a dataset of 75 models and examine the performance on MCTS against our previous best local search-based algorithm in terms of toolpath quality. We show that a relatively short time budget for MCTS yields results on par with local search, while a larger time budget yields a 15% improvement in quality over local search. Additionally, we examine the properties of the models and MCTS executions that lead to better or worse results.

AB  - Flexible manufacturing and automation require robots that can be adapted to changing tasks. We propose to use modular robots that are customized from given modules for a specific task. This work presents an algorithm for proposing a module composition that is optimal with respect to performance metrics such as cycle time and energy efficiency, while considering kinematic, dynamic, and obstacle constraints. Tasks are defined as trajectories in Cartesian space, as a list of poses for the robot to reach as fast as possible, or as dexterity in a desired workspace. In a simulated comparison with commercially available industrial robots, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach in randomly generated tasks with respect to the chosen performance metrics. We use our modular robot proModular.1 for the comparison.
