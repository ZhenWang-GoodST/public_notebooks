AB  - We propose an efficient method for monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that is capable of estimating metrically-scaled motion without additional sensors or hardware acceleration by integrating metric depth predictions from a neural network into a geometric SLAM factor graph. Unlike learned end-to-end SLAM systems, ours does not ignore the relative geometry directly observable in the images. Unlike existing learned depth estimation approaches, ours leverages the insight that when used to estimate scale, learned depth predictions need only be coarse in image space. This allows us to shrink our network to the point that performing inference on a standard CPU becomes computationally tractable.We make several improvements to our network architecture and training procedure to address the lack of depth observability when using coarse images, which allows us to estimate spatially coarse, but depth-accurate predictions in only 30 ms per frame without GPU acceleration. At runtime we incorporate the learned metric data as unary scale factors in a Sim(3) pose graph. Our method is able to generate accurate, scaled poses without additional sensors, hardware accelerators, or special maneuvers and does not ignore or corrupt the observable epipolar geometry. We show compelling results on the KITTI benchmark dataset in addition to real-world experiments with a handheld camera.

AB  - We formulate for the first time visual-inertial initialization as an optimal estimation problem, in the sense of maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation. This allows us to properly take into account IMU measurement uncertainty, which was neglected in previous methods that either solved sets of algebraic equations, or minimized ad-hoc cost functions using least squares. Our exhaustive initialization tests on EuRoC dataset show that our proposal largely outperforms the best methods in the literature, being able to initialize in less than 4 seconds in almost any point of the trajectory, with a scale error of 5.3% on average. This initialization has been integrated into ORB-SLAM Visual-Inertial boosting its robustness and efficiency while maintaining its excellent accuracy.

AB  - Accurate, robust and real-time localization under constrained-resources is a critical problem to be solved. In this paper, we present a new sparse pose-graph visual-inertial SLAM (SPVIS). Unlike the existing methods that are costly to deal with a large number of redundant features and 3D map points, which are inefficient for improving positioning accuracy, we focus on the concise visual cues for high-precision pose estimating. We propose a novel hierarchical quadtree based optical flow tracking algorithm, it achieves high accuracy and robustness within very few concise features, which is only about one fifth features of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM algorithms. Benefiting from the efficient optical flow tracking, our sparse pose-graph optimization time cost achieves bounded complexity. By selecting and optimizing the informative features in sliding window and local VIO, the computational complexity is bounded, it achieves low time cost in long-term operation. We compare with the state-of-the-art VIO/VI-SLAM systems on the challenging public datasets by the embedded platform without GPUs, the results effectively verify that the proposed method has better real-time performance and localization accuracy.

AB  - Keypoint matching is an important operation in computer vision and its applications such as visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in robotics. This matching operation heavily depends on the descriptors of the keypoints, and it must be performed reliably when images undergo conditional changes such as those in illumination and viewpoint. In this paper, a descriptor fusion model (DFM) is proposed to create a robust keypoint descriptor by fusing CNN-based descriptors using autoencoders. Our DFM architecture can be adapted to either trained or pre-trained CNN models. Based on the performance of existing CNN descriptors, we choose HardNet and DenseNet169 as representatives of trained and pre-trained descriptors. Our proposed DFM is evaluated on the latest benchmark datasets in computer vision with challenging conditional changes. The experimental results show that DFM is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance, with the mean mAP that is 6.45% and 6.53% higher than HardNet and DenseNet169, respectively.

AB  - Sparse-indirect SLAM systems have been dominantly popular due to their computational efficiency and photometric invariance properties. Depth sensors are critical to SLAM frameworks for providing scale information to the 3D world, yet known to be plagued by a wide variety of noise sources, possessing lateral and axial components. In this work, we demonstrate the detrimental impact of these depth noise components on the performance of the state-of-the-art sparse-indirect SLAM system (ORB-SLAM2). We propose (i) Map-Point Consensus based Outlier Rejection (MC-OR) to counter lateral noise, and (ii) Adaptive Virtual Camera (AVC) to combat axial noise accurately. MC-OR utilizes consensus information between multiple sightings of the same landmark to disambiguate noisy depth and filter it out before pose optimization. In AVC, we introduce an error vector as an accurate representation of the axial depth error. We additionally propose an adaptive algorithm to find the virtual camera location for projecting the error used in the objective function of the pose optimization. Our techniques work equally well for stereo image pairs and RGB-D input directly used by sparse-indirect SLAM systems. Our methods were tested on the TUM (RGB-D) and EuRoC (stereo) datasets and we show that they outperform existing state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM2 by 2-3x, especially in sequences critically affected by depth noise.

AB  - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in large-scale, unknown, and complex subterranean environments is a challenging problem. Sensors must operate in off-nominal conditions; uneven and slippery terrains make wheel odometry inaccurate, while long corridors without salient features make exteroceptive sensing ambiguous and prone to drift; finally, spurious loop closures that are frequent in environments with repetitive appearance, such as tunnels and mines, could result in a significant distortion of the entire map. These challenges are in stark contrast with the need to build highly-accurate 3D maps to support a wide variety of applications, ranging from disaster response to the exploration of underground extraterrestrial worlds. This paper reports on the implementation and testing of a lidar-based multi-robot SLAM system developed in the context of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. We present a system architecture to enhance subterranean operation, including an accurate lidar-based front-end, and a flexible and robust back-end that automatically rejects outlying loop closures. We present an extensive evaluation in large-scale, challenging subterranean environments, including the results obtained in the Tunnel Circuit of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Finally, we discuss potential improvements, limitations of the state of the art, and future research directions.

AB  - When incorporating deep neural networks into robotic systems, a major challenge is the lack of uncertainty measures associated with their output predictions. Methods for uncertainty estimation in the output of deep object detectors (DNNs) have been proposed in recent works, but have had limited success due to 1) information loss at the detectors nonmaximum suppression (NMS) stage, and 2) failure to take into account the multitask, many-to-one nature of anchor-based object detection. To that end, we introduce BayesOD, an uncertainty estimation approach that reformulates the standard object detector inference and Non-Maximum suppression components from a Bayesian perspective. Experiments performed on four common object detection datasets show that BayesOD provides uncertainty estimates that are better correlated with the accuracy of detections, manifesting as a significant reduction of 9.77%-13.13% on the minimum Gaussian uncertainty error metric and a reduction of 1.63%-5.23% on the minimum Categorical uncertainty error metric. Code will be released at https://github.com/asharakeh/bayes-od-rc.

AB  - Robots coexisting with humans in their environment and performing services for them need the ability to interact with them. One particular requirement for such robots is that they are able to understand spatial relations and can place objects in accordance with the spatial relations expressed by their user. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network for estimating pixelwise object placement probabilities for a set of spatial relations from a single input image. During training, our network receives the learning signal by classifying hallucinated high-level scene representations as an auxiliary task. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require ground truth data for the pixelwise relational probabilities or 3D models of the objects, which significantly expands the applicability in practical applications. Our results obtained using real-world data and human-robot experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reasoning about the best way to place objects to reproduce a spatial relation.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in the area of computer vision. The disparity estimation problem tends to be addressed by DNNs which achieve much better prediction accuracy in stereo matching than traditional hand-crafted feature based methods. On one hand, however, the designed DNNs require significant memory and computation resources to accurately predict the disparity, especially for those 3D convolution based networks, which makes it difficult for deployment in real-time applications. On the other hand, existing computation-efficient networks lack expression capability in large-scale datasets so that they cannot make an accurate prediction in many scenarios. To this end, we propose an efficient and accurate deep network for disparity estimation named FADNet with three main features: 1) It exploits efficient 2D based correlation layers with stacked blocks to preserve fast computation; 2) It combines the residual structures to make the deeper model easier to learn; 3) It contains multi-scale predictions so as to exploit a multi-scale weight scheduling training technique to improve the accuracy. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of FADNet on two popular datasets, Scene Flow and KITTI 2015. Experimental results show that FADNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, and runs at a significant order of magnitude faster speed than existing 3D models. The codes of FADNet are available at https://github.com/HKBU-HPML/FADNet.

AB  - Deep learning has become an increasingly common technique for various control problems, such as robotic arm manipulation, robot navigation, and autonomous vehicles. However, the downside of using deep neural networks to learn control policies is their opaque nature and the difficulties of validating their safety. As the networks used to obtain state-of-the-art results become increasingly deep and complex, the rules they have learned and how they operate become more challenging to understand. This presents an issue, since in safety-critical applications the safety of the control policy must be ensured to a high confidence level. In this paper, we propose an automated black box testing framework based on adversarial reinforcement learning. The technique uses an adversarial agent, whose goal is to degrade the performance of the target model under test. We test the approach on an autonomous vehicle problem, by training an adversarial reinforcement learning agent, which aims to cause a deep neural network-driven autonomous vehicle to collide. Two neural networks trained for autonomous driving are compared, and the results from the testing are used to compare the robustness of their learned control policies. We show that the proposed framework is able to find weaknesses in both control policies that were not evident during online testing and therefore, demonstrate a significant benefit over manual testing methods.

AB  - A longstanding challenge in robot learning for manipulation tasks has been the ability to generalize to varying initial conditions, diverse objects, and changing objectives. Learning based approaches have shown promise in producing robust policies, but require heavy supervision and large number of environment interactions, especially from visual inputs. We propose a novel self-supervision technique that uses time-reversal to provide high level supervision to reach goals. In particular, we introduce the time-reversal model (TRM), a self-supervised model which explores outward from a set of goal states and learns to predict these trajectories in reverse. This provides a high level plan towards goals, allowing us to learn complex manipulation tasks with no demonstrations or exploration at test time. We test our method on the domain of assembly, specifically the mating of tetris-style block pairs. Using our method operating atop visual model predictive control, we are able to assemble tetris blocks on a KuKa IIWA-7 using only uncalibrated RGB camera input, and generalize to unseen block pairs.

AB  - Path planning is an active area of research essential for many applications in robotics. Popular techniques include graph-based searches and sampling-based planners. These approaches are powerful but have limitations.This paper continues work to combine their strengths and mitigate their limitations using a unified planning paradigm. It does this by viewing the path planning problem as the two subproblems of search and approximation and using advanced graph-search techniques on a sampling-based approximation.This perspective leads to Advanced BIT*. ABIT* combines truncated anytime graph-based searches, such as ATD*, with anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal sampling-based planners, such as RRT*. This allows it to quickly find initial solutions and then converge towards the optimum in an anytime manner. ABIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling- based planners on the tested problems in ‚Ñù4 and ‚Ñù8, and was demonstrated on real-world problems with NASA/JPL-Caltech.

AB  - One major challenge in Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) for complex real-world CAD-scenarios is to find appropriate disassembly paths for all assembled parts. Such a path places demands on its length and clearance. In the past, it became apparent that planning the disassembly path based on the (approximate) General Voronoi Diagram (GVD) is a good approach to achieve these requirements. But for complex real-world data, every known solution for computing the GVD is either too slow or very memory consuming, even if only approximating the GVD.We present a new approach for computing the approximate GVD and demonstrate its practicability using a representative vehicle data set. We can calculate an approximation of the GVD within minutes and meet the accuracy requirement of some few millimeters for the subsequent path planning. This is achieved by voxelizing the surface with a common error-bounded GPU render approach. We then use an error-bounded wavefront propagation technique and combine it with a novel hash table-based data structure, the so-called Voronoi Voxel History (VVH). On top of the GVD, we present a novel approach for the creation of a General Voronoi Diagram Graph (GVDG) that leads to an extensive roadmap. For the later motion planning task this roadmap can be used to suggest appropriate disassembly paths.

AB  - In this work, we propose an augmentation to the Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) framework which allows the system to generalize to moving goals without the use of any known or approximation model for estimating the goal's motion. We aim to maintain the demonstrated velocity levels during the execution to the moving goal, generating motion profiles appropriate for human robot collaboration. The proposed method employs a modified version of a DMP, learned by a demonstration to a static goal, with adaptive temporal scaling in order to achieve reaching of the moving goal with the learned kinematic pattern. Only the current position and velocity of the goal are required. The goal's reaching error and its derivative is proved to converge to zero via contraction analysis. The theoretical results are verified by simulations and experiments on a KUKA LWR4+ robot.

AB  - In this paper, we revisit model predictive control (MPC) for the classical wheeled mobile robot (WMR) navigation problem. We prove that the reachable set based hierarchical MPC (HMPC), a state-of-the-art MPC, cannot handle WMR navigation in theory due to the non-existence of non-trivial linear system with an under-approximate reachable set of WMR. Nevertheless, we propose a virtual linear leader guided MPC (VLL-MPC) to enable HMPC structure. Different from current HMPCs, we use a virtual linear system with an under-approximate path set rather than the traditional trace set to guide the WMR. We provide a valid construction of the virtual linear leader. We prove the stability of VLL-MPC, and discuss its complexity. In the experiment, we demonstrate the advantage of VLL-MPC empirically by comparing it with NMPC, LMPC and anytime RRT* in several scenarios.

AB  - This paper is about the closely-related problems of localization and aggregation for extremely simple robots, for which the only available action is to move in a given direction as far as the geometry of the environment allows. Such problems may arise, for example, in biomedical applications, wherein a large group of tiny robots moves in response to a shared external stimulus. Specifically, we extend the prior work on these kinds of problems presenting two algorithms for localization in environments with curved (rather than polygonal) boundaries and under low-friction models of interaction with the environment boundaries. We present both simulations and physical demonstrations to validate the approach.

AB  - Stable flight control under ceilings is difficult for multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The wake interaction between rotors and upper walls, called the "ceiling effect", causes an increase of rotor thrust. As a result of the thrust increase, multi-rotors are drawn upward abruptly and collide with ceilings. In previous work, several thrust models of the ceiling effect have been proposed for stable flight under ceilings, assuming that the airflow around rotors is in steady states. However, the airflow around rotors in vertical flight is not in steady states and each thrust model in previous work is skillfully determined based on large amounts of precise experimental data. In this paper, we introduce an aerodynamics-based thrust model and a stable control method under ceilings. This model is derived from the momentum theory and the relationship between vertical climbing/descending rates of rotors and an induced velocity. To confirm our proposed model, we collect thrust data at various vertical rates in flight. In addition, we use only onboard sensors to estimate selfstate for structural inspections. Consequently, we reveal that the proposed model is consistent with the experimental results. Based on an aerodynamic model, we need not collect large amounts of precise experimental data to realize stable flight. Furthermore, the vertical flight tests under ceilings demonstrate that our in-unsteady-state-model-based controller outperforms the conventional steady-state ones.

AB  - This paper presents a novel path planning strategy for fast and agile exploration using aerial robots. Tailored to the combined need for large-scale exploration of challenging and confined environments, despite the limited endurance of micro aerial vehicles, the proposed planner employs motion primitives to identify admissible paths that search the configuration space, while exploiting the dynamic flight properties of small aerial robots. Utilizing a computationally efficient volumetric representation of the environment, the planner provides fast collision-free and future-safe paths that maximize the expected exploration gain and ensure continuous fast navigation through the unknown environment. The new method is field-verified in a set of deployments relating to subterranean exploration and specifically, in both modern and abandoned underground mines in Northern Nevada utilizing a 0.55m-wide collision-tolerant flying robot exploring with a speed of up to 2m/s and navigating sections with width as small as 0.8m.

AB  - We propose a novel anomaly detection framework for a fleet of hybrid aerial vehicles executing high-speed package pickup and delivery missions. The detection is based on machine learning models of normal flight profiles, trained on millions of flight log measurements of control inputs and sensor readings. We develop a new scalable algorithm for robust regression which can simultaneously fit predictive flight dynamics models while identifying and discarding abnormal flight missions from the training set. The resulting unsupervised estimator has a very high breakdown point and can withstand massive contamination of training data to uncover what normal flight patterns look like, without requiring any form of prior knowledge of aircraft aerodynamics or manual labeling of anomalies upfront. Across many different anomaly types, spanning simple 3sigma statistical thresholds to turbulence and other equipment anomalies, our models achieve high detection rates across the board. Our method consistently outperforms alternative robust detection methods on synthetic benchmark problems. To the best of our knowledge, dynamics modeling of hybrid delivery drones for anomaly detection at the scale of 100 million measurements from 5000 real flight missions in variable flight conditions is unprecedented.

AB  - Correlation filter-based tracking has been widely applied in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with high efficiency. However, it has two imperfections, i.e., boundary effect and filter corruption. Several methods enlarging the search area can mitigate boundary effect, yet introducing undesired background distraction. Existing frame-by-frame context learning strategies for repressing background distraction nevertheless lower the tracking speed. Inspired by keyframe-based simultaneous localization and mapping, keyfilter is proposed in visual tracking for the first time, in order to handle the above issues efficiently and effectively. Keyfilters generated by periodically selected keyframes learn the context intermittently and are used to restrain the learning of filters, so that 1) context awareness can be transmitted to all the filters via keyfilter restriction, and 2) filter corruption can be repressed. Compared to the state-of-the-art results, our tracker performs better on two challenging benchmarks, with enough speed for UAV real-time applications.

AB  - Regrasping is one of the most common and important manipulation skills used in our daily life. However, aerial regrasping has not been seriously investigated yet, since most of the aerial manipulator lacks dexterous manipulation abilities except for the basic pick-and-place. In this paper, we focus on pivoting a long box, which is one of the most classical problems among regrasping researches, using a transformable multilink aerial robot. First, we improve our previous controller by compensating for the external wrench. Second, we optimize the joints configuration of our transformable multilink drone for stable grasping form under the constraints of thrust force and joints effort. Third, we sequentially optimize the grasping force in the pivoting process. The optimization goal is to generate continous grasping force whilst maximizing the friction force in case of the downwash, which would influence the grasped object and is difficult to model. Fourth, we develop the impedance controller in joint space and admittance controller in task space. As far as we know, it is the first research to achieve extrinsic contact-aware regrasping task on aerial robots.

AB  - Robots operating in outdoor, urban environments need the ability to follow complex natural language commands which refer to never-before-seen landmarks. Existing approaches to this problem are limited because they require training a language model for the landmarks of a particular environment before a robot can understand commands referring to those landmarks. To generalize to new environments outside of the training set, we present a framework that parses references to landmarks, then assesses semantic similarities between the referring expression and landmarks in a predefined semantic map of the world, and ultimately translates natural language commands to motion plans for a drone. This framework allows the robot to ground natural language phrases to landmarks in a map when both the referring expressions to landmarks and the landmarks themselves have not been seen during training. We test our framework with a 14-person user evaluation demonstrating an end-to-end accuracy of 76.19% in an unseen environment. Subjective measures show that users find our system to have high performance and low workload. These results demonstrate our approach enables untrained users to control a robot in large unseen outdoor environments with unconstrained natural language.

AB  - Vehicles at highway merging sections must make lane changes to join the highway. This lane change can generate congestion. To reduce congestion, vehicles should merge so as not to affect traffic flow as much as possible. In our study, we propose a vehicle controller called Deep Merging that uses deep reinforcement learning to improve the merging efficiency of vehicles while considering the impact on traffic flow. The system uses the images of a merging section as input to output the target vehicle speed. Moreover, an embedding network for estimating the controlled vehicle speed is introduced to the deep reinforcement learning network architecture to improve the learning efficiency. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the merging behavior and traffic conditions in several situations are verified by experiments using a traffic simulator. Through these experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed method enables controlled vehicles to effectively merge without adversely affecting to the traffic flow.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that the performance of an object detector degrades when it is used outside the domain of the data used to train it. However, obtaining training data for a new domain can be time consuming and expensive. In this work we demonstrate how a radar can be used to generate plentiful (but noisy) training data for image-based vehicle detection. We then show that the performance of a detector trained using the noisy labels can be considerably improved through a combination of noise-aware training techniques and relabelling of the training data using a second viewpoint. In our experiments, using our proposed process improves average precision by more than 17 percentage points when training from scratch and 10 percentage points when fine-tuning a pre-trained model.

AB  - Formula Student Driverless (FSD) is a competition where student teams compete to build an autonomous racecar. The main dynamic event in FSD is trackdrive, where the racecar traverses an unknown track with lanes demarcated by cones. One major challenge of the event is to determine the boundaries of the lane from cones perceived online despite false positive cone detections and sharp turns. We present a binary integer optimization to address this problem by leveraging a priori knowledge from competition rules on parameters such as average cone spacings and minimum track width. In this paper, we describe our approach, and analyze its latency, accuracy, and robustness to false positive cone detections. This approach is used on-board to solve the lane detection problem during the competition in real-time.

AB  - Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of intelligent vehicles contributes to improving cruise control performance, reducing traffic congestion, saving energy and increasing traffic flow capacity. In this paper, we resolve the CACC problem from the viewpoint of synchronization control, our main idea is to introduce the spatial-temporal synchronization mechanism into vehicle platoon control to achieve the robust CACC and to further realize the non-stop intersection control. Firstly, by introducing the cross-coupling based space synchronization mechanism, a distributed control algorithm is presented to achieve the single-lane CACC in the presence of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which enables autonomous vehicles to track the desired platoon trajectory while synchronizing their longitudinal velocities to keeping the expected inter-vehicle distance. Secondly, by designing the enter-time scheduling mechanism (temporal synchronization), a high-level intersection control strategy is proposed to command vehicles to form a virtual platoon to pass through the intersection without stopping. Thirdly, a Lyapunov-based time-domain stability analysis approach is presented. Compared with the traditional string stability based approach, the proposed approach guarantees the global asymptotical convergence of the proposed CACC system. Experiments in the small-scale simulated system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Hand-crafting generalised decision-making rules for real-world urban autonomous driving is hard. Alternatively, learning behaviour from easy-to-collect human driving demonstrations is appealing. Prior work has studied imitation learning (IL) for autonomous driving with a number of limitations. Examples include only performing lane-following rather than following a user-defined route, only using a single camera view or heavily cropped frames lacking state observability, only lateral (steering) control, but not longitudinal (speed) control and a lack of interaction with traffic. Importantly, the majority of such systems have been primarily evaluated in simulation - a simple domain, which lacks real-world complexities. Motivated by these challenges, we focus on learning representations of semantics, geometry and motion with computer vision for IL from human driving demonstrations. As our main contribution, we present an end-to-end conditional imitation learning approach, combining both lateral and longitudinal control on a real vehicle for following urban routes with simple traffic. We address inherent dataset bias by data balancing, training our final policy on approximately 30 hours of demonstrations gathered over six months. We evaluate our method on an autonomous vehicle by driving 35km of novel routes in European urban streets.

AB  - Accurate and reliable localization is crucial to autonomous vehicle navigation and driver assistance systems. This paper presents a novel approach for online vehicle localization in a digital map. Two distinct map matching algorithms are proposed: i) Iterative Closest Point (ICP) based lane level map matching is performed with visual lane tracker and grid map ii) decision-rule based approach is used to perform topological map matching. Results of both the map matching algorithms are fused together with GPS and dead reckoning using Extended Kalman Filter to estimate vehicle's pose relative to the map. The proposed approach has been validated on real life conditions on an equipped vehicle. Detailed analysis of the experimental results show improved localization using the two aforementioned map matching algorithms.

AB  - This paper presents a new technique to solve the Indoor Visual Place Recognition problem from the Deep Learning perspective. It consists on an image retrieval approach supported by a novel image similarity metric. Our work uses a 3D laser sensor mounted on a backpack with a calibrated spherical camera i) to generate the data for training the deep neural network and ii) to build a database of geo-referenced images for an environment. The data collection stage is fully automatic and requires no user intervention for labelling. Thanks to the 3D laser measurements and the spherical panoramas, we can efficiently survey large indoor areas in a very short time. The underlying 3D data associated to the map allows us to define the similarity between two training images as the geometric overlap between the observed pixels. We exploit this similarity metric to effectively train a CNN that maps images into compact embeddings. The goal of the training is to ensure that the L2 distance between the embeddings associated to two images is small when they are observing the same place and large when they are observing different places. After the training, similarities between a query image and the geo-referenced images in the database are efficiently retrieved by performing a nearest neighbour search in the embeddings space.

AB  - Pose estimation and map building are central ingredients of autonomous robots and typically rely on the registration of sensor data. In this paper, we investigate a new metric for registering images that builds upon on the idea of the photometric error. Our approach combines a gradient orientation-based metric with a magnitude-dependent scaling term. We integrate both into stereo estimation as well as visual odometry systems and show clear benefits for typical disparity and direct image registration tasks when using our proposed metric. Our experimental evaluation indicate that our metric leads to more robust and more accurate estimates of the scene depth as well as camera trajectory. Thus, the metric improves camera pose estimation and in turn the mapping capabilities of mobile robots. We believe that a series of existing visual odometry and visual SLAM systems can benefit from the findings reported in this paper.

AB  - A robot operating in the world constantly receives information about its environment in the form of new measurements at every time step. Smoothing-based estimation methods seek to optimize for the most likely robot state estimate using all measurements up till the current time step. Existing methods solve for this smoothing objective efficiently by framing the problem as that of incremental unconstrained optimization. However, in many cases observed measurements and knowledge of the environment is better modeled as hard constraints derived from real-world physics or dynamics. A key challenge is that the new optimality conditions introduced by the hard constraints break the matrix structure needed for incremental factorization in these incremental optimization methods. Our key insight is that if we leverage primal-dual methods, we can recover a matrix structure amenable to incremental factorization. We propose a framework ICS that combines a primal-dual method like the Augmented Lagrangian with an incremental Gauss Newton approach that reuses previously computed matrix factorizations. We evaluate ICS on a set of simulated and real-world problems involving equality constraints like object contact and inequality constraints like collision avoidance.

AB  - Besides being part of the Internet of Things (IoT), drones can play a relevant role in it as enablers. The 3D mobility of UAVs can be exploited to improve node localization in IoT networks for, e.g., search and rescue or goods localization and tracking. One of the widespread IoT communication technologies is Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), which allows achieving long communication distances with low power. In this work, we present a drone-aided localization system for LoRa networks in which a UAV is used to improve the estimation of a node's location initially provided by the network. We characterize the relevant parameters of the communication system and use them to develop and test a search algorithm in a realistic simulated scenario. We then move to the full implementation of a real system in which a drone is seamlessly integrated into Swisscom's LoRa network. The drone coordinates with the network with a two-way exchange of information which results in an accurate and fully autonomous localization system. The results obtained in our field tests show a ten-fold improvement in localization precision with respect to the estimation provided by the fixed network. Up to our knowledge, this is the first time a UAV is successfully integrated in a LoRa network to improve its localization accuracy.

We focus on handheld/mobile devices but the method can be useful for a variety of wearable devices. Our system works with sparse WiFi or image-based measurements, avoiding laborious site surveying for dense signal maps and runs in real-time. It uses Conditional Random Fields to infer the most probable sequence of agent positions from a known floor plan, dead reckoning and sparse absolute position estimates. Our solution leverages known topology of the environment by pre-computing allowed motion sequences of an agent, which are then used to constraint the motion inferred from the sensory data. The system is evaluated in a typical office building, demonstrating good accuracy and robustness to sparse, low-quality measurements.

These environments are subject to changes in the traversability that often happen following patterns. In this paper, we investigate the problem of navigating in such environments over extended periods of time by capturing and exploiting these patterns to make informed decisions for navigation. Our approach uses a probabilistic graphical model to incrementally estimate a model of the traversability changes from the robot's observations and to make predictions at currently unobserved locations. In the belief space defined by the predictions, we plan paths that trade off the risk to encounter obstacles and the information gain of visiting unknown locations. We implemented our approach and tested it in different indoor environments. The experiments suggest that, in the long run, our approach leads robots to navigate along shorter paths compared to following a greedy shortest path policy.

AB  - Gaussian processes (GPs) based Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods with Model Predictive Control (MPC) have demonstrated their excellent sample efficiency. However, since the computational cost of GPs largely depends on the training sample size, learning an accurate dynamics using GPs result in low control frequency in MPC. To alleviate this trade-off and achieve a sample-and-computation-efficient nature, we propose a novel model-based RL method with MPC. Our approach employs a linear Gaussian model with randomized features using the Fastfood as an approximated GP dynamics. Then, we derive an analytic moment-matching scheme in state prediction with the model and uncertain inputs. As a result, the computational cost of the MPC in our RL method does not depend on the training sample size and can improve the control frequency over previous methods. Through experiments with simulated and real robot control tasks, the sample efficiency, as well as the computation efficiency of our model-based RL method, are demonstrated.

AB  - Robotic manipulators are reaching a state where we could see them in household environments in the following decade. Nevertheless, such robots need to be easy to instruct by lay people. This is why kinesthetic teaching has become very popular in recent years, in which the robot is taught a motion that is encoded as a parametric function - usually a Movement Primitive (MP)-. This approach produces trajectories that are usually suboptimal, and the robot needs to be able to improve them through trial-and-error. Such optimization is often done with Policy Search (PS) reinforcement learning, using a given reward function. PS algorithms can be classified as model-free, where neither the environment nor the reward function are modelled, or model-based, which can use a surrogate model of the reward function and/or a model for the dynamics of the task. However, MPs can become very high-dimensional in terms of parameters, which constitute the search space, so their optimization often requires too many samples. In this paper, we assume we have a robot motion task characterized with an MP of which we cannot model the dynamics. We build a surrogate model for the reward function, that maps an MP parameter latent space (obtained through a Mutual-information-weighted Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model) into a reward. While we do not model the task dynamics, using mutual information to shrink the task space makes it more consistent with the reward and so the policy improvement is faster in terms of sample efficiency.

AB  - This paper provides a real time on-board algorithm for a biplane-quadrotor to iteratively learn a forward transition maneuver via repeated flight trials. The maneuver is controlled by regulating the pitch angle and propeller thrust according to feedforward control laws that are parameterized by polynomials. Based on a nominal model with simplified aerodynamics, the optimal coefficients of the polynomials are chosen through simulation such that the maneuver is completed with specified terminal conditions on altitude and air speed. In order to compensate for modeling errors, repeated flight trials are performed by updating the feedforward control parameters according to an iterative learning algorithm until the maneuver is perfected. A geometric attitude controller, valid for all flight modes is employed in order to track the pitch angle according to the feedforward law. Further, a high-fidelity thrust model of the propeller for varying advance-ratio and orientation angle is obtained from wind tunnel data which is captured using a neural network model. This facilitates accurate application of feedforward thrust for varying flow conditions during transition. Experimental flight trials are performed to demonstrate the robustness and rapid convergence of the proposed learning algorithm.

AB  - We propose a learning algorithm for automating image sampling in scientific applications. We consider settings where images are sampled by controlling a probe beam's scanning trajectory over the image surface. We explore alternatives to obtaining images by the standard rastering method. We formulate the scanner control problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and train a policy to adaptively sample only the highest value regions of the image, choosing the acquisition time and resolution for each sample position based on an observation of previous readings. We use convolutional neural network (CNN) policies to control the scanner as a way to generalize our approach to larger samples. We show simulation results for a simple policy on both synthetic data and real world data from an archaeological application.

AB  - Gaussian processes (GPs) enable a probabilistic approach to important estimation and classification tasks that arise in robotics applications. Meanwhile, most GP-based methods are often prohibitively slow, thereby posing a substantial barrier to practical applications. Existing "sparse" methods to speed up GPs seek to either make the model more sparse, or find ways to more efficiently manage a large covariance matrix. In this paper, we present an orthogonal approach that memoises (i.e. reuses) previous computations in GP inference. We demonstrate that a substantial speedup can be achieved by incorporating memoisation into applications in which GPs must be updated frequently. Moreover, we derive a novel online update scheme for sparse GPs that can be used in conjunction with our memoisation approach for a synergistic improvement in performance. Across three robotic vision applications, we demonstrate between 40-100% speed-up over the standard method for inference in GP mixtures.

AB  - Surgical robots have been introduced to operating rooms over the past few decades due to their high sensitivity, small size, and remote controllability. The cable-driven nature of many surgical robots allows the systems to be dexterous and lightweight, with diameters as low as 5mm. However, due to the slack and stretch of the cables and the backlash of the gears, inevitable uncertainties are brought into the kinematics calcu-lation [1]. Since the reported end effector position of surgical robots like RAVEN-II [2] is directly calculated using the motor encoder measurements and forward kinematics, it may contain relatively large error up to 10mm, whereas semi-autonomous functions being introduced into abdominal surgeries require position inaccuracy of at most 1mm. To resolve the problem, a cost-effective, real-time and data-driven pipeline for robot end effector position precision estimation is proposed and tested on RAVEN-II. Analysis shows an improved end effector position error of around 1mm RMS traversing through the entire robot workspace without high-resolution motion tracker.

AB  - Many tasks in robot-assisted surgeries (RAS) can be represented by finite-state machines (FSMs), where each state represents either an action (such as picking up a needle) or an observation (such as bleeding). A crucial step towards the automation of such surgical tasks is the temporal perception of the current surgical scene, which requires a real-time estimation of the states in the FSMs. The objective of this work is to estimate the current state of the surgical task based on the actions performed or events occurred as the task progresses. We propose Fusion-KVE, a unified surgical state estimation model that incorporates multiple data sources including the Kinematics, Vision, and system Events. Additionally, we examine the strengths and weaknesses of different state estimation models in segmenting states with different representative features or levels of granularity. We evaluate our model on the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS), as well as a more complex dataset involving robotic intra-operative ultrasound (RIOUS) imaging, created using the da Vinci¬Æ Xi surgical system. Our model achieves a superior frame-wise state estimation accuracy up to 89.4%, which improves the state-of-the-art surgical state estimation models in both JIGSAWS suturing dataset and our RIOUS dataset.

AB  - Assistive robotic arms enable users with physical disabilities to perform everyday tasks without relying on a caregiver. Unfortunately, the very dexterity that makes these arms useful also makes them challenging to teleoperate: the robot has more degrees-of-freedom than the human can directly coordinate with a handheld joystick. Our insight is that we can make assistive robots easier for humans to control by leveraging latent actions. Latent actions provide a low-dimensional embedding of high-dimensional robot behavior: for example, one latent dimension might guide the assistive arm along a pouring motion. In this paper, we design a teleoperation algorithm for assistive robots that learns latent actions from task demonstrations. We formulate the controllability, consistency, and scaling properties that user-friendly latent actions should have, and evaluate how different low-dimensional embeddings capture these properties. Finally, we conduct two user studies on a robotic arm to compare our latent action approach to both state-of-the-art shared autonomy baselines and a teleoperation strategy currently used by assistive arms. Participants completed assistive eating and cooking tasks more efficiently when leveraging our latent actions, and also subjectively reported that latent actions made the task easier to perform.

AB  - Torque distribution in redundant robots that combine the potential of asymmetric series-parallel actuated branches and multi-articulation pose a non-trivial challenge. To address the problem, this work proposes a novel optimization based controller that can accommodate various quadratic criteria to perform the torque distribution among dissimilar series and parallel actuators in order to maximize the motion efficiency. Three candidate criteria are composed and their performances are compared during periodic squat motions with a 3 degree of freedom series-parallel compliant articulated leg prototype. It is first shown that by minimizing a criterion that takes into account the actuator hardware specifications such as torque constant and transmission ratio, the gravity-driven phases can be lengthened. Thereby, this particular criterion results in slightly better performance than when adopting a strategy that maximizes the torque allocation to the higher efficiency actuators. Furthermore, valuable insights such as that the efficacy of maximum utilization of the highly-efficient parallel actuation branches decreases progressively at high frequencies were observed.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel factor graph formulation to estimate the pose and velocity of a quadruped robot on slippery and deformable terrain. The factor graph introduces a preintegrated velocity factor that incorporates velocity inputs from leg odometry and also estimates related biases. From our experimentation we have seen that it is difficult to model uncertainties at the contact point such as slip or deforming terrain, as well as leg flexibility. To accommodate for these effects and to minimize leg odometry drift, we extend the robot's state vector with a bias term for this preintegrated velocity factor. The bias term can be accurately estimated thanks to the tight fusion of the preintegrated velocity factor with stereo vision and IMU factors, without which it would be unobservable. The system has been validated on several scenarios that involve dynamic motions of the ANYmal robot on loose rocks, slopes and muddy ground. We demonstrate a 26% improvement of relative pose error compared to our previous work and 52% compared to a state-of-the-art proprioceptive state estimator.

AB  - Energy-efficient locomotion is of primary importance for legged robot to extend operation time in practical applications. This paper presents an approach to achieve energy-efficient locomotion for a quadrupedal robot walking over challenging terrains. Firstly, we optimize the nominal stance parameters based on the analysis of leg torque distribution. Secondly, we proposed the foothold planner and the center of gravity (COG) trajectory planner working together to guide the robot to place its standing legs in an energy-saving stance posture. We have validated the effectiveness of our method on a real quadrupedal robot in experiments including autonomously walking on plain ground and climbing stairs.

AB  - Optimization based predictive control is a powerful tool that has improved the ability of legged robots to execute dynamic maneuvers and traverse increasingly difficult terrains. However, it is often challenging and unintuitive to design meaningful cost functions and build high-fidelity models while adhering to timing restrictions. A novel framework to extract and design principled regularization heuristics for legged locomotion optimization control is presented. By allowing a simulation to fully explore the cost space offline, certain states and actions can be constrained or isolated. Data is fit with simple models relating the desired commands, optimal control actions, and robot states to identify new heuristic candidates. Basic parameter learning and adaptation laws are then applied to the models online. This method extracts simple, but powerful heuristics that can approximate complex dynamics and account for errors stemming from model simplifications and parameter uncertainty without the loss of physical intuition while generalizing the parameter tuning process. Results on the Mini Cheetah robot verify the increased capabilities due to the newly extracted heuristics without any modification to the controller structure or gains.

AB  - Learning to locomote to arbitrary goals on hardware remains a challenging problem for reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present a hierarchical framework that improves sample-efficiency and generalizability of learned locomotion skills on real-world robots. Our approach divides the problem of goal-oriented locomotion into two sub-problems: learning diverse primitives skills, and using model-based planning to sequence these skills. We parametrize our primitives as cyclic movements, improving sample-efficiency of learning from scratch on a 18 degrees of freedom robot. Then, we learn coarse dynamics models over primitive cycles and use them in a model predictive control framework. This allows us to learn to walk to arbitrary goals up to 12m away, after about two hours of training from scratch on hardware. Our results on a Daisy hexapod hardware and simulation demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at reaching distant targets, in different environments, and with sensory noise.

AB  - Soft robotics technology creates new ways for legged robots to interact with and adapt to their environment. In this paper we develop i) a new 2-degree-of-freedom soft pneumatic actuator, and ii) a novel soft robotic hexapedal robot called SoRX that leverages the new actuators. Simulation and physical testing confirm that the proposed actuator can generate cyclic foot trajectories that are appropriate for legged locomotion. Consistent with other hexapedal robots (and animals), SoRX employs an alternating tripod gait to propel itself forward. Experiments reveal that SoRX can reach forward speeds of up to 0.44 body lengths per second, or equivalently 101 mm/s. With a size of 230 mm length, 140 mm width and 100 mm height, and weight of 650 grams, SoRX is among the fastest tethered soft pneumatically-actuated legged robots to date. The motion capabilities of SoRX are evaluated through five experiments: running, step climbing, and traversing rough terrain, steep terrain, and unstable terrain. Experimental results show that SoRX is able to operate over challenging terrains in open-loop control and by following the same alternating tripod gait across all experimental cases.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in many applications. The limited flight time of UAVs, however, still remains as a major challenge. Although numerous approaches have been developed to recharge the battery of UAVs effectively, little is known about optimal methodologies to deploy charging stations. In this paper, we address the charging station deployment problem with an aim to find the optimal number and locations of charging stations such that the system performance is maximized. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and propose UBAT, a heuristic framework based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve the problem. Additionally, a suite of algorithms are designed to enhance the execution time and the quality of the solutions for UBAT. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that UBAT effectively performs multi-objective optimization of generation of UAV trajectories and placement of charging stations that are within 8.3% and 7.3% of the true optimal solutions, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents a new efficient algorithm which guarantees a solution for a class of multi-agent trajectory planning problems in obstacle-dense environments. Our algorithm combines the advantages of both grid-based and optimization-based approaches, and generates safe, dynamically feasible trajectories without suffering from an erroneous optimization setup such as imposing infeasible collision constraints. We adopt a sequential optimization method with dummy agents to improve the scalability of the algorithm, and utilize the convex hull property of Bernstein and relative Bernstein polynomial to replace non-convex collision avoidance constraints to convex ones. The proposed method can compute the trajectory for 64 agents on average 6.36 seconds with Intel Core i7-7700 @ 3.60GHz CPU and 16G RAM, and it reduces more than 50% of the objective cost compared to our previous work. We validate the proposed algorithm through simulation and flight tests.

AB  - We study the problem of sequential task assignment and collision-free routing for large teams of robots in applications with inter-task precedence constraints (e.g., task A and task B must both be completed before task C may begin). Such problems commonly occur in assembly planning for robotic manufacturing applications, in which sub-assemblies must be completed before they can be combined to form the final product. We propose a hierarchical algorithm for computing makespan-optimal solutions to the problem. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of randomly generated problem instances where robots must transport objects between stations in a "factory" grid world environment. In addition, we demonstrate in high-fidelity simulation that the output of our algorithm can be used to generate collision-free trajectories for non-holonomic differential-drive robots.

AB  - The challenges of multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments lie in uncertainties in obstacle complexities, partially observation of robots, and policy implementation from simulations to the real world. This paper presents a cooperative approach to address the multi-robot navigation problem (MRNP) under dynamic environments using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which can help multiple robots jointly achieve optimal paths despite a certain degree of obstacle complexities. The novelty of this work includes threefold: (1) developing a cooperative architecture that robots can exchange information with each other to select the optimal target locations; (2) developing a DRL based framework which can learn a navigation policy to generate the optimal paths for multiple robots; (3) developing a training mechanism based on dynamics randomization which can make the policy generalized and achieve the maximum performance in the real world. The method is tested with Gazebo simulations and 4 differential drive robots. Both simulation and experiment results validate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of success rate and travel time when compared with the other state-of-art technologies.

AB  - Autonomous navigation through unknown and complex environments is a fundamental capability that is essential in almost all robotic applications. Optimal robot path planning is critical to enable efficient navigation. Path planning is a complex, compute and memory intensive task. Traditional methods employ either graph based search methods or sample based methods to implement path planning, which are sub-optimal and compute/memory-intensive. To this end, an Adaptive Directional Planner (ADP) algorithm is devised to achieve real-time, energy-efficient, memory-optimized, robust local path planning for enabling efficient autonomous navigation of mobile robots. The ADP algorithm ensures that the paths are optimal and kinematically-feasible. Further, the proposed algorithm is tested with different challenging scenarios verifying the functionality and robustness. The ADP algorithm implementation results demonstrate 40- 60X less number of nodes and 40 - 50X less execution time compared to the standard TP-RRT schemes, without compromising on accuracy. Finally, the algorithm has also been implemented as an accelerator for non-holonomic, multi-shape, small form factor mobile robots to provide a silicon solution with high performance and low memory footprint (28KB).

AB  - This paper presents a robot trajectory optimization formulation that builds upon numerical optimal control and Lie group methods. In particular, the inherent sparsity of direct collocation is carefully analyzed to dramatically reduce the number of floating-point operations to get first-order information of the problem. We describe how sparsity exploitation is employed with both numerical and analytical differentiation. Furthermore, the use of geometric algorithms based on Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras allow to analytically evaluate the state equations and their derivatives with efficient recursive algorithms. We demonstrate the scalability of the proposed formulation with three different articulated robots, such as a finger, a mobile manipulator and a humanoid composed of five, eight and more than twenty degrees of freedom, respectively. The performance of our implementation in C++ is also validated and compared against a state-of-the-art general purpose numerical optimal control solver.

AB  - Autonomous cars and fixed-wing aerial vehicles have the so-called non-holonomic kinematics which non-linearly maps control input to states. As a result, trajectory optimization with such a motion model becomes highly non-linear and non-convex. In this paper, we improve the computational tractability of non-holonomic trajectory optimization by reformulating it in terms of a set of bi-convex cost and constraint functions along with a non-linear penalty. The bi-convex part acts as a relaxation for the non-holonomic trajectory optimization while the residual of the penalty dictates how well its output obeys the non-holonomic behavior. We adopt an alternating minimization approach for solving the reformulated problem and show that it naturally leads to the replacement of the challenging non-linear penalty with a globally valid convex surrogate. Along with the common cost functions modeling goal-reaching, trajectory smoothness, etc., the proposed optimizer can also accommodate a class of non-linear costs for modeling goal-sets, while retaining the bi-convex structure. We benchmark the proposed optimizer against off-the-shelf solvers implementing sequential quadratic programming and interior-point methods and show that it produces solutions with similar or better cost as the former while significantly outperforming the latter. Furthermore, as compared to both off-the-shelf solvers, the proposed optimizer achieves more than 20x reduction in computation time.

AB  - As we build our legged robots smaller and cheaper, stable and agile control without expensive inertial sensors becomes increasingly important. We seek to enable versatile dynamic behaviors on robots with limited modes of state feedback, specifically proprioceptive-only sensing. This work uses model-based trajectory optimization methods to design open-loop stable motion primitives. We specifically design running gaits for a single-legged planar robot, and can generate motion primitives in under 3 seconds, approaching online-capable speeds. A direct-collocation-formulated optimization generated axial force profiles for the direct-drive robot to achieve desired running speed and apex height. When implemented in hardware, these trajectories produced open-loop stable running. Further, the measured running achieved the desired speed within 10% of the speed specified for the optimization in spite of having no control loop actively measuring or controlling running speed. Additionally, we examine the shape of the optimized force profile and observe features that may be applicable to open-loop stable running in general.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an optimization-based decision-making tool for safe motion planning and control in an environment with randomly moving obstacles. The unique feature of the proposed method is that it limits the risk of unsafety by a pre-specified threshold even when the true probability distribution of the obstacles' movements deviates, within a Wasserstein ball, from an available empirical distribution. Another advantage is that it provides a probabilistic out-of-sample performance guarantee of the risk constraint. To develop a computationally tractable method for solving the distributionally robust model predictive control problem, we propose a set of reformulation procedures using (i) the Kantorovich duality principle, (ii) the extremal representation of conditional value-at-risk, and (iii) a geometric expression of the distance to the union of halfspaces. The performance and utility of this distributionally robust method are demonstrated through simulations using a 12D quadrotor model in a 3D environment.

AB  - We present a new method to generate optimal grasps for brittle and fragile objects using a novel stress- minimization (SM) metric. Our approach is designed for objects that are composed of homogeneous isotopic materials. Our SM metric measures the maximal resistible external wrenches that would not result in fractures in the target objects. In this paper, we propose methods to compute our new metric. We also use our SM metric to design optimal grasp planning algorithms. Finally, we compare the performance of our metric and conventional grasp metrics, including Q1,Q‚àû,QG11,QMSV,QVEW. Our experiments show that our SM metric takes into account the material characteristics and object shapes to indicate the fragile regions, where prior methods may not work well. We also show that the computational cost of our SM metric is on par with prior methods. Finally, we show that grasp planners guided by our metric can lower the probability of breaking target objects.

AB  - A robust grasp controller for both slipping avoidance and controlled sliding is proposed based on force/tactile feedback only. The model-based algorithm exploits a modified LuGre friction model to consider rotational frictional sliding motions. The modification relies on the Limit Surface concept where a novel computationally efficient method is introduced to compute in real-time the minimum grasping force to balance tangential and torsional loads. The two control modalities are considered by the robot motion planning algorithm that automatically generates robot motions and gripper commands to solve complex manipulation tasks in a material handling application.

AB  - Manipulating objects whose physical properties are unknown remains one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Controlling grasp force is an essential aspect of handling unknown objects without slipping or crushing them. Although extensive research has been carried out on grasp force control, unknown object manipulation is still difficult because conventional approaches assume that object properties (mass, center of gravity, friction coefficient, etc.) are known for grasp force control. One of the approaches to address this issue is incipient slip detection. However, there has been few detailed investigations of robust detection and control of incipient slip on rotational case. This study makes contributions on deriving the theoretical model of incipient slip and proposes a new algorithm to detect incipient slip. Additionally, a novel sensor configuration and a grasp force control algorithm based on the derived theoretical model are proposed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated by grasping objects with different weights and moments including a fragile pastry (√©clair).

AB  - Humans can quickly determine the force required to grasp a deformable object to prevent its sliding or excessive deformation through vision and touch, which is still a challenging task for robots. To address this issue, we propose a novel 3D convolution-based visual-tactile fusion deep neural network (C3D-VTFN) to evaluate the grasp state of various deformable objects in this paper. Specifically, we divide the grasp states of deformable objects into three categories of sliding, appropriate and excessive. Also, a dataset for training and testing the proposed network is built by extensive grasping and lifting experiments with different widths and forces on 16 various deformable objects with a robotic arm equipped with a wrist camera and a tactile sensor. As a result, a classification accuracy as high as 99.97% is achieved. Furthermore, some delicate grasp experiments based on the proposed network are implemented in this paper. The experimental results demonstrate that the C3D-VTFN is accurate and efficient enough for grasp state assessment, which can be widely applied to automatic force control, adaptive grasping, and other visual-tactile spatiotemporal sequence learning problems.

AB  - Current end-to-end grasp planning methods propose grasps in the order of seconds that attain high grasp success rates on a diverse set of objects, but often by constraining the workspace to top-grasps. In this work, we present a method that allows end-to-end top-grasp planning methods to generate full six-degree-of-freedom grasps using a single RGBD view as input. This is achieved by estimating the complete shape of the object to be grasped, then simulating different viewpoints of the object, passing the simulated viewpoints to an end-to-end grasp generation method, and finally executing the overall best grasp. The method was experimentally validated on a Franka Emika Panda by comparing 429 grasps generated by the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Grasp Quality CNN, both on simulated and real camera images. The results show statistically significant improvements in terms of grasp success rate when using simulated images over real camera images, especially when the real camera viewpoint is angled.

AB  - Consumer demand for augmented reality (AR) in mobile phone applications, such as the Apple ARKit. Such applications have potential to expand access to robot grasp planning systems such as Dex-Net. AR apps use structure from motion methods to compute a point cloud from a sequence of RGB images taken by the camera as it is moved around an object. However, the resulting point clouds are often noisy due to estimation errors. We present a distributed pipeline, Dex-Net AR, that allows point clouds to be uploaded to a server in our lab, cleaned, and evaluated by Dex-Net grasp planner to generate a grasp axis that is returned and displayed as an overlay on the object. We implement Dex-Net AR using the iPhone and ARKit and compare results with those generated with high-performance depth sensors. The success rates with AR on harder adversarial objects are higher than traditional depth images. The server URL is https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/dex-net-ar/home.

AB  - In this paper, we present an omnidirectional localization and dense mapping system for a wide-baseline multiview stereo setup with ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) fisheye cameras, which has a 360¬∞ coverage of stereo observations of the environment. For more practical and accurate reconstruction, we first introduce improved and light-weighted deep neural networks for the omnidirectional depth estimation, which are faster and more accurate than the existing networks. Second, we integrate our omnidirectional depth estimates into the visual odometry (VO) and add a loop closing module for global consistency. Using the estimated depth map, we reproject keypoints onto each other view, which leads to a better and more efficient feature matching process. Finally, we fuse the omnidirectional depth maps and the estimated rig poses into the truncated signed distance function (TSDF) volume to acquire a 3D map. We evaluate our method on synthetic datasets with ground-truth and real-world sequences of challenging environments, and the extensive experiments show that the proposed system generates excellent reconstruction results in both synthetic and real-world environments.

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in taking advantage of the 360¬∞ panoramic images potential, while managing the new challenges they imply. While several tasks have been improved thanks to the contextual information these images offer, object recognition in indoor scenes still remains a challenging problem that has not been deeply investigated. This paper provides an object recognition system that performs object detection and semantic segmentation tasks by using a deep learning model adapted to match the nature of equirectangular images. From these results, instance segmentation masks are recovered, refined and transformed into 3D bounding boxes that are placed into the 3D model of the room. Quantitative and qualitative results support that our method outperforms the state of the art by a large margin and show a complete understanding of the main objects in indoor scenes.

AB  - Fisheye cameras are commonly used in applications like autonomous driving and surveillance to provide a large field of view (> 180o). However, they come at the cost of strong non-linear distortions which require more complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore Euclidean distance estimation on fisheye cameras for automotive scenes. Obtaining accurate and dense depth supervision is difficult in practice, but self-supervised learning approaches show promising results and could potentially overcome the problem. We present a novel self-supervised scale-aware framework for learning Euclidean distance and ego-motion from raw monocular fisheye videos without applying rectification. While it is possible to perform piece-wise linear approximation of fisheye projection surface and apply standard rectilinear models, it has its own set of issues like re-sampling distortion and discontinuities in transition regions. To encourage further research in this area, we will release our dataset as part of the WoodScape project [1]. We further evaluated the proposed algorithm on the KITTI dataset and obtained state-of-the-art results comparable to other self-supervised monocular methods. Qualitative results on an unseen fisheye video demonstrate impressive performance1.

AB  - Recently, end-to-end trainable deep neural networks have significantly improved stereo depth estimation for perspective images. However, 360¬∞ images captured under equirectangular projection cannot benefit from directly adopting existing methods due to distortion introduced (i.e., lines in 3D are not projected onto lines in 2D). To tackle this issue, we present a novel architecture specifically designed for spherical disparity using the setting of top-bottom 360¬∞ camera pairs. Moreover, we propose to mitigate the distortion issue by (1) an additional input branch capturing the position and relation of each pixel in the spherical coordinate, and (2) a cost volume built upon a learnable shifting filter. Due to the lack of 360¬∞ stereo data, we collect two 360¬∞ stereo datasets from Matterport3D and Stanford3D for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments and ablation study are provided to validate our method against existing algorithms. Finally, we show promising results on real-world environments capturing images with two consumer-level cameras. Our project page is at https://albert100121.github.io/360SD-Net-Project-Page.

AB  - Omnidirectional 360¬∞ camera proliferates rapidly for autonomous robots since it significantly enhances the perception ability by widening the field of view (FoV). However, corresponding 360¬∞ depth sensors, which are also critical for the perception system, are still difficult or expensive to have. In this paper, we propose a low-cost 3D sensing system that combines an omnidirectional camera with a calibrated projective depth camera, where the depth from the limited FoV can be automatically extended to the rest of recorded omnidirectional image. To accurately recover the missing depths, we design an omnidirectional depth extension convolutional neural network (ODE-CNN), in which a spherical feature transform layer (SFTL) is embedded at the end of feature encoding layers, and a deformable convolutional spatial propagation network (D-CSPN) is appended at the end of feature decoding layers. The former re-samples the neighborhood of each pixel in the omnidirectional coordination to the projective coordination, which reduce the difficulty of feature learning, and the later automatically finds a proper context to well align the structures in the estimated depths via CNN w.r.t. the reference image, which significantly improves the visual quality. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed ODE-CNN over the popular 360D dataset, and show that ODE-CNN significantly outperforms (relatively 33% reduction in depth error) other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods.

AB  - 3D orientation estimation is a key component of many important computer vision tasks such as autonomous navigation and 3D scene understanding. This paper presents a new CNN architecture to estimate the 3D orientation of an omnidirectional camera with respect to the world coordinate system from a single spherical panorama. To train the proposed architecture, we leverage a dataset of panoramas named VOP60K from Google Street View with labeled 3D orientation, including 50 thousand panoramas for training and 10 thousand panoramas for testing. Previous approaches usually estimate 3D orientation under pinhole cameras. However, for a panorama, due to its larger field of view, previous approaches cannot be suitable. In this paper, we propose an edge extractor layer to utilize the low-level and geometric information of panorama, an attention module to fuse different features generated by previous layers. A regression loss for two column vectors of the rotation matrix and classification loss for the position of vanishing points are added to optimize our network simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is validated on our benchmark, and experimental results clearly demonstrate that it outperforms previous methods.

AB  - The only way to perceive a small object held between our fingers is to trust our sense of touch. Touch provides cues about the state of the contact even if its view is occluded by the finger. The interaction between the soft fingers and the surface reveals crucial information, such as the local shape of the object, that plays a central role in fine manipulation. In this work, we present a new spherical sensor that endows robots with a fine distributed sense of touch. This sensor is an evolution of our distributed tactile sensor that measures the dense 3-dimensional displacement field of an elastic membrane, using the subtractive color-mixing principle. We leverage a planar manufacturing process that enables the design and manufacturing of the functional features on a flat surface. The flat functional panels are then folded to create a spherical shape able to sense a wide variety of objects.The resulting 40mm-diameter spherical sensor has 77 measurement points, each of which gives an estimation of the local 3d displacement, normal and tangential to the surface. Each marker is built around 2 sets of colored patches placed at different depths. The relative motion and resulting hue of each marker, easily captured by an embedded RGB camera, provides a measurement of their 3d motion. To benchmark the sensor, we compared the measurements obtained while pressing the sensor on a curved surface with Hertz contact theory, a hallmark of contact mechanics. While the mechanics did strictly follow Hertz contact theory, using the shear and normal sensing, ChromaTouch can estimate the curvature of an object after a millimeter-size indentation of the sensor.

AB  - An unstable grasp pose can lead to slip, thus an unstable grasp pose can be predicted by slip detection. A regrasp is required afterwards to correct the grasp pose in order to finish the task. In this work, we propose a novel regrasp planner with multi-sensor modules to plan grasp adjustments with the feedback from a slip detector. Then a regrasp planner is trained to estimate the location of center of mass, which helps robots find an optimal grasp pose. The dataset in this work consists of 1 025 slip experiments and 1 347 regrasps collected by one pair of tactile sensors, an RGB-D camera and one Franka Emika robot arm equipped with joint force/torque sensors. We show that our algorithm can successfully detect and classify the slip for 5 unknown test objects with an accuracy of 76.88% and a regrasp planner increases the grasp success rate by 31.0% compared to the state-of-the-art vision-based grasping algorithm.

AB  - Incorporating touch as a sensing modality for robots can enable finer and more robust manipulation skills. Existing tactile sensors are either flat, have small sensitive fields or only provide low-resolution signals. In this paper, we introduce OmniTact, a multi-directional high-resolution tactile sensor. OmniTact is designed to be used as a fingertip for robotic manipulation with robotic hands, and uses multiple micro-cameras to detect multi-directional deformations of a gel-based skin. This provides a rich signal from which a variety of different contact state variables can be inferred using modern image processing and computer vision methods. We evaluate the capabilities of OmniTact on a challenging robotic control task that requires inserting an electrical connector into an outlet, as well as a state estimation problem that is representative of those typically encountered in dexterous robotic manipulation, where the goal is to infer the angle of contact of a curved finger pressing against an object. Both tasks are performed using only touch sensing and deep convolutional neural networks to process images from the sensor's cameras. We compare with a state-of-the-art tactile sensor that is only sensitive on one side, as well as a state-of-the-art multi-directional tactile sensor, and find that OmniTact's combination of high-resolution and multi-directional sensing is crucial for reliably inserting the electrical connector and allows for higher accuracy in the state estimation task.

AB  - Texture sensing is one of the types of information sensed by humans through touch, and is thus of interest to robotics that this type of information can be acquired and processed. In this work we present a texture topography sensor based on a ciliary structure, a biological structure found in many organisms. The device consists of up to 9 elastic cilia with permanent magnetization assembled on top of a highly sensitive tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor, within a compact footprint of 6√ó6 mm2. When these cilia brush against some textured surface, their movement and vibrations give rise to a signal that can be correlated to the characteristics of the texture being measured. We also present an electronic signal acquisition board, used in this work. Various configurations of cilia sizes are tested, with the most precise being capable of differentiating different types of sandpaper from 9.2 Œºm to 213 Œºm average surface roughness with a 7 Œºm resolution. As a topography scanner the sensor was able to scan a 20 Œºm high step in a flat surface.

AB  - Remote characterisation of the environment during physical robot-environment interaction is an important task commonly accomplished in telerobotics. This paper demonstrates how tactile and proximity sensing can be efficiently used to perform automatic crack detection. A custom-designed integrated tactile and proximity sensor is implemented. It measures the deformation of its body when interacting with the physical environment and distance to the environment's objects with the help of fibre optics. This sensor was used to slide across different surfaces and the data recorded during the experiments was used to detect and classify cracks, bumps and undulations. The proposed method uses machine learning techniques (mean absolute value as feature and random forest as classifier) to detect cracks and determine their width. An average crack detection accuracy of 86.46% and width classification accuracy of 57.30% is achieved. Kruskal-Wallis results (p<; 0.001) indicate statistically significant differences among results obtained when analysing only force data, only proximity data and both force and proximity data. In contrast to previous techniques, which mainly rely on visual modality, the proposed approach based on optical fibres is suitable for operation in extreme environments, such as nuclear facilities in which nuclear radiation may damage the electronic components of video cameras.

AB  - We propose a new capacitive proximity sensor that detects deformations of a suction cup as a tactile sense. We confirmed that one sensor module provides three applications for reliable picking and a simplified setup. The first application is the picking height decision. The second one is the placing height decision for detecting whether the grasped object is placed on the placement surface. These two applications are achieved by detecting the push-in stroke of the suction cup. The final application is detection of whether the suction cup is in partial contact or full contact with the object. This function can correct the picking posture as well as detect whether picking is possible before the pull-up motion. We also demonstrate that the partial contact position can be estimated in real time.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel filtering-based method that fuses events from a dynamic vision sensor (DVS), images, and inertial measurements to estimate camera poses. A DVS is a bio-inspired sensor that generates events triggered by brightness changes. It can cover the drawbacks of a conventional camera by virtual of its independent pixels and high dynamic range. Specifically, we focus on optical flow obtained from both a stream of events and intensity images in which the former is much like a differential quantity, whereas the latter is a pixel difference in a much longer time interval than events. This nature characteristic motivates us to model optical flow estimated from events directly, but feature tracks for images in the filter design. An inequality constraint is considered in our method since the inverse scene-depth is larger than zero by its definition. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed method in the benchmark DVS dataset and a dataset collected by the authors. The results reveal that the presented algorithm has reduced the position error by 49.9% on average and comparable accuracy only using events when compared to the state-of-the-art filtering-based estimator.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the effect of tightly-coupled estimation on the performance of visual-inertial localization and dynamic object pose tracking. In particular, we show that while a joint estimation system outperforms its decoupled counterpart when given a "proper" model for the target's motion, inconsistent modeling, such as choosing improper levels for the target's propagation noises, can actually lead to a degradation in ego-motion accuracy. To address the realistic scenario where a good prior knowledge of the target's motion model is not available, we design a new system based on the Schmidt-Kalman Filter (SKF), in which target measurements do not update the navigation states, however all correlations are still properly tracked. This allows for both consistent modeling of the target errors and the ability to update target estimates whenever the tracking sensor receives non-target data such as bearing measurements to static, 3D environmental features. We show in extensive simulation that this system, along with a robot-centric representation of the target, leads to robust estimation performance even in the presence of an inconsistent target motion model. Finally, the system is validated in a real-world experiment, and is shown to offer accurate localization and object pose tracking performance.

AB  - The advances in deep reinforcement learning recently revived interest in data-driven learning based approaches to navigation. In this paper we propose to learn viewpoint invariant and target invariant visual servoing for local mobile robot navigation; given an initial view and the goal view or an image of a target, we train deep convolutional network controller to reach the desired goal. We present a new architecture for this task which rests on the ability of establishing correspondences between the initial and goal view and novel reward structure motivated by the traditional feedback control error. The advantage of the proposed model is that it does not require calibration and depth information and achieves robust visual servoing in a variety of environments and targets without any parameter fine tuning. We present comprehensive evaluation of the approach and comparison with other deep learning architectures as well as classical visual servoing methods in visually realistic simulation environment [1]. The presented model overcomes the brittleness of classical visual servoing based methods and achieves significantly higher generalization capability compared to the previous learning approaches.

AB  - In this work, we propose a tightly-coupled odometry framework, which combines monocular visual feature observations with distance measurements provided by a single ultra-wideband (UWB) anchor with an initial guess for its location. Firstly, the scale factor and the anchor position in the vision frame will be simultaneously estimated using a variant of Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares optimization scheme. Once the scale factor is obtained, the map of visual features is updated with the new scale. Subsequent ranging errors in a sliding window are continuously monitored and the estimation procedure will be reinitialized to refine the estimates. Lastly, range measurements and anchor position estimates are fused when needed into a pose-graph optimization scheme to minimize both the landmark reprojection errors and ranging errors, thus reducing the visual drift and improving the system robustness. The proposed method is implemented in Robot Operating System (ROS) and can function in real-time. The performance is validated on both public datasets and real-life experiments and compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Visual topological navigation has been revitalized recently thanks to the advancement of deep learning that substantially improves robot perception. However, the scalability and reliability issue remain challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of real world images and mechanical constraints of real robots. We present an intuitive approach to show that by accurately measuring the capability of a local controller, large-scale visual topological navigation can be achieved while being scalable and robust. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in trajectory following and planning in large-scale environments. It also generalizes well to real robots and new environments without retraining or finetuning.

AB  - Imitation learning is a popular approach for training effective visual navigation policies. However, collecting expert demonstrations for legged robots is challenging as these robots can be hard to control, move slowly, and cannot operate continuously for long periods of time. In this work, we propose a zero-shot imitation learning framework for training a goal-driven visual navigation policy on a legged robot from human demonstrations (third-person perspective), allowing for high-quality navigation and cost-effective data collection. However, imitation learning from third-person demonstrations raises unique challenges. First, these demonstrations are captured from different camera perspectives, which we address via a feature disentanglement network (FDN) that extracts perspective-invariant state features. Second, as transition dynamics vary between systems, we reconstruct missing action labels by either building an inverse model of the robot's dynamics in the feature space and applying it to the human demonstrations or developing a Graphic User Interface (GUI) to label human demonstrations. To train a navigation policy we use a model-based imitation learning approach with FDN and action-labeled human demonstrations. We show that our framework can learn an effective policy for a legged robot, Laikago, from human demonstrations in both simulated and real-world environments. Our approach is zero-shot as the robot never navigates the same paths during training as those at testing time. We justify our framework by performing a comparative study.

AB  - The high deformability and compliance of soft robots allow safer interaction with the environment. On the other hand, these advantages bring along controllability and predictability challenges which result in loss of force and stiffness output. Such challenges should be addressed in order to improve the overall functional performance and to meet the requirements of real-scenario applications. In this paper, we present a bidirectional in-plane manipulator which consists of two unidirectional fiber-reinforced actuators (FRAs) and a hybrid soft-rigid stiffness control structure (SCS), all of them controlled by air pressure. Both controllability and predictability of the manipulator are enhanced by the hybrid soft-rigid structure. While the FRAs provide positioning and position dependent stiffness, the SCS increases the stiffness of the manipulator without position dependency. The SCS is able to increase the manipulator stiffness by 35%, 30%, and 18%, when one FRA is pressurized at 150 kPa, 75 kPa, and 0 kPa, respectively. Experiments are carried out to present the feasibility of the proposed manipulator.

AB  - Soft growing robots are proposed for use in applications such as complex manipulation tasks or navigation in disaster scenarios. Safe interaction and ease of production promote the usage of this technology, but soft robots can be challenging to teleoperate due to their unique degrees of freedom. In this paper, we propose a human-centered interface that allows users to teleoperate a soft growing robot for manipulation tasks using arm movements. A study was conducted to assess the intuitiveness of the interface and the performance of our soft robot, involving a pick-and-place manipulation task. The results show that users were able to complete the task 97% of the time and achieve placement errors below 2 cm on average. These results demonstrate that our body-movement-based interface is an effective method for control of a soft growing robot manipulator.

AB  - Restoring healthy kinematics is a critical component of assisting and rehabilitating impaired locomotion. Here we tested whether spatiotemporal gait patterns can be modulated by applying mechanical impedance to hip joints. Using the Samsung GEMS-H exoskeleton, we emulated a virtual spring (positive and negative) between the user's legs. We found that applying positive stiffness with the exoskeleton decreased stride time and hip range of motion for healthy subjects during treadmill walking. Conversely, the application of negative stiffness increased stride time and hip range of motion. These effects did not vary over long nor short repeated exposures to applied stiffness. In addition, minimal transient behavior was observed in spatiotemporal measures of gait when the stiffness controller transitioned between on and off states. These results suggest that changes in gait behavior induced by applying hip stiffness were purely a mechanical effect. Together, our findings indicate that applying mechanical impedance using lower-limb assistive devices may be an effective, minimally-encumbering intervention to restore healthy gait patterns.

AB  - This paper presents the design and implementation of a controller for stair ascent and descent in a primarily-passive stance-controlled swing-assist (SCSA) prosthesis. The prosthesis and controller enable users to perform both step-over and step-to stair ascent and descent. The efficacy of the controller and SCSA prosthesis prototype in providing improved stair ambulation was tested on a unilateral transfemoral amputee in experiments that employed motion capture apparatus to compare joint kinematics with the SCSA prosthesis, relative to performing the same activity with a microprocessor-controlled daily-use passive prosthesis. Results suggest that the SCSA knee significantly decreases compensatory motion during stair activity when compared to the passive prosthesis.

AB  - Pneumatic transmission has several advantages in developing powered ankle foot orthosis (AFO) systems, such as the flexibility in placing pneumatic components for mass distribution and providing high back-drivability via simple valve control. However, pneumatic systems are generally tethered to large stationary air compressors that restrict them for being used as daily assistive devices. In this study, we improved a previously developed wearable (untethered) custom compressor that can be worn (1.5 kg) at the waist of the body and can generate adequate amount of pressurized air (maximum pressure of 1050 kPa and a flow rate of 15.1 mL/sec at 550 kPa) to power a unilateral active AFO used to assist the dorsiflexion (DF) motion of drop-foot patients. The finalized system can provide a maximum assistive torque of 10 Nm and induces an average 0.03¬±0.06 Nm resistive torque when free movement is provided. The system was tested for two unilateral drop-foot patients. The proposed system showed an average improvement of 13.6¬∞ of peak dorsiflexion angle during the swing phase of the gait cycle.

AB  - Robotic prostheses provide new opportunities to better restore lost functions than passive prostheses for trans-femoral amputees. But controlling a prosthesis device automatically for individual users in different task environments is an unsolved problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a naturally promising tool. For prosthesis control with a user in the loop, it is desirable that the controlled prosthesis can adapt to different task environments as quickly and smoothly as possible. However, most RL agents learn or relearn from scratch when the environment changes. To address this issue, we propose the knowledge-guided Q-learning (KG-QL) control method as a principled way for the problem. In this report, we collected and used data from two able-bodied (AB) subjects wearing a RL controlled robotic prosthetic limb walking on level ground. Our ultimate goal is to build an efficient RL controller with reduced time and data requirements and transfer knowledge from AB subjects to amputee subjects. Toward this goal, we demonstrate its feasibility by employing OpenSim, a well-established human locomotion simulator. Our results show the OpenSim simulated amputee subject improved control tuning performance over learning from scratch by utilizing knowledge transfer from AB subjects. Also in this paper, we will explore the possibility of information transfer from AB subjects to help tuning for the amputee subjects.

AB  - This paper presents a study on a compliant cable-driven exoskeleton for hip assistance in lifting tasks that is aimed at preventing low-back pain and injuries in the vocational setting. In the proposed concept, we used twisted string actuator (TSA) to design a light-weight and powerful exoskeleton that benefits from inherent TSA advantages. We have noted that nonlinear nature of twisted strings' transmission ratio (decreasing with twisting) closely matched typical torque-speed requirements for hip assistance during lifting tasks and tried to use this fact in the exoskeleton design and motor selection. Hip-joint torque and speed required to lift a 10-kg load from stoop to stand were calculated, which gave us a baseline that we used to design and manufacture a practical exoskeleton prototype. Preliminary experimental trials demonstrated that the proposed device was capable of generating required torque and speed at the hip joint while weighing under 6 kg, including battery.

AB  - This paper presents a novel portable passive lower limb exoskeleton for walking assistance. The exoskeleton is designed with built-in spring mechanisms at the hip and knee joints to realize gravity balancing of the human leg. A pair of mating gears is used to convert the tension force from the built-in springs into balancing torques at hip and knee joints for overcoming the influence of gravity. Such a design makes the exoskeleton has a compact layout with small protrusion, which improves its safety and user acceptance. In this paper, the design principle of gravity balancing is described. Simulation results show a significant reduction of driving torques at the limb joints. A prototype of single leg exoskeleton has been constructed and preliminary test results show the effectiveness of the exoskeleton.

AB  - This paper investigates a burrowing robot that can maneuver and steer while being submerged in a granular medium. The robot locomotes using an internal vibro-impact mechanism and steers using a rotating bevel-tip head. We formulate and investigate a non-holonomic model for the steering mechanism and a hybrid dynamics model for the thrusting mechanism. We perform a numerical analysis of the dynamics of the robot's thrusting mechanism using a simplified, orientation and depth dependent model for the drag forces acting on the robot. We first show, in simulation, that by carefully tuning various control input parameters, the thrusting mechanism can drive the robot both forward and backward. We present several experiments designed to evaluate and verify the simulative results using a proof-of-concept robot. We show that different input amplitudes indeed affect the direction of motion, as suggested by the simulation. We further demonstrate the ability of the robot to perform a simple S-shaped trajectory. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the robot's design and fidelity of the model.

AB  - This paper presents a novel physical gripping framework intended for controlled, high force density attachment on a range of surfaces. Our framework utilizes a light-activated chemical adhesive to attach to surfaces. The cured adhesive is part of a "sacrificial layer," which is shed when the gripper separates from the surface. In order to control adhesive behavior we utilize ultraviolet (UV) light sensitive acrylics which are capable of rapid curing when activated with 380nm light. Once cured, zero input power is needed to hold load. Thin plastic parts can be used as the sacrificial layers, and these can be released using an electric motor. This new gripping framework including the curing load capacity, adhesive deposition, and sacrificial methods are described in detail. Two proof-of concept prototypes are designed, built, and tested. The experimental results illustrate the response time (15-75s depending on load), high holding force-to-weight ratio (10-30), and robustness to material type. Additionally, two drawbacks of this design are discussed: corruption of the gripped surface and a limited number of layers.

AB  - In this paper, the optimization of the anchor points of a cable driven parallel robot (CDPR) for 3D printing is proposed in order to maximize the rigidity. Indeed, in the context of 3D printing, robot stiffness should guarantee a high level of tool path following accuracy. The optimized platform showed a rigidity improvement in simulation, but also experimentally with a first study of vibration modes. In the same time, this study illustrates the influence of preload in cables on the platform rigidity.

AB  - This work presents a novel design concept that achieves multi-legged locomotion using a three-dimensional cam system. A computational framework has been developed to analyze and dimension this cam apparatus, that can perform arbitrary end effector motions within its design constraints. The mechanism enables continuous gait transition and inherent force compliance. With only two motors, any trajectory of a continuous set of gaits can be followed. One motor is used to actuate the system and a second one to morph its movement. To illustrate a possible application of this system, a working prototype of a bipedal robot is developed and validated in hardware. It showcases a smooth velocity change by transitioning through different gaits from standing still to walking fast at 124mm/s within 2.0s, while following the given end effector trajectory with an error of only 2.47mm.

AB  - In order to accomplish various missions, autonomous ground vehicles must operate on a wide range of terrain. While many systems such as wheels and whegs can navigate some types of terrain, none are optimal across all. This creates a need for physical adaptation. This paper presents a broad new approach to physical adaptation that relies on manipulation. Specifically, we explore how multipurpose manipulators can enable ground vehicles to dramatically modify their propulsion system in order to optimize performance across various terrain. While this approach is general and widely applicable, this work focuses on physically switching between wheels and legs. We outline the design of "swappable propulsors" that combine the powerful adhesion forces of permanent magnets with geometric features for easy detachment. We provide analysis on how the swappable propulsors can be manipulated, and use these results to create a functional prototype robot. This robot can use its manipulator to change between wheeled and legged locomotion. Our experimental results illustrate how this approach can enhance energy efficiency and versatility.

AB  - This paper focuses on designing, modeling and validating a novel scalable multicopter whose deformation mechanism, called SNIAE-SSE, relies on a combination of simple non-intersecting angulated elements (SNIAEs) and straight scissor-like elements (SSEs). The proposed SNIAE-SSE mechanism has the advantages of single degree-of-freedom, fast actuation capability and large deformation ratio. In this work, enabled by the SNIAE-SSE mechanism, a quadcopter prototype with symmetrical and synchronous deformation is firstly developed, which facilitates a novel and controllably scalable multicopter system for us to analyze its modeling, as well as to validate its flight performance and dynamics during the deformation in several flight missions including hover, throwing, and morphing flying through a narrow window. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed scalable multicopter can maintain its stable flight behavior even both the folding and unfolding body deformations are fast performed, which indicates an excellent capability of the scalable multicopter to rapidly adapt to complex and dynamically changed environments.

AB  - Cooperative autonomy and data sharing can largely improve the mission performance of robotic networks in underwater surveillance applications. In this paper, we describe the cooperative autonomy used to control the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) acting as sonar receiver nodes in the CMRE Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) network. The paper focuses on a track management module that was integrated in the robot autonomy software for enabling the share of information. Track to track (T2T) associations are used for improving track classification and for creating a common tactical picture, necessary for AUV cooperative strategies. We also present a new cooperative data-driven AUV behaviour that exploits the spatial diversity of multiple robots for improving target tracking and for facilitating T2T associations. We report results with real data collected at sea that validate the approach. The reported results are one of the first examples that show the potential of cooperative autonomy and data fusion in realistic underwater surveillance scenarios characterised by limited communications.

AB  - Battery life, reliability, and localization are prominent challenges in the design of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This work aims to address facets of these challenges using a single system. We describe the design of a bidirectional resonant pump that uses a single electromagnetic voice coil motor (VCM) capable of rotation around a central two degree-of-freedom flexure stage axis. This actuator design produces highly efficient resonant motion that drives two orthogonally oriented diaphragms simultaneously. The operation of this diaphragm pump mechanism produces both adjustable thrust vectors at the aft surface of the AUV and a monotonic relationship between thrust vectors and operating frequency. We propose using the unique frequency to thrust relationship to enhance AUV localization capabilities. We construct a prototype and use it to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the directionally-tunable resonance concept.

AB  - We present an efficient approach for finding shortest paths in flow fields that vary as a sequence of flow predictions over time. This approach is applicable to motion planning for slow marine robots that are subject to dynamic ocean currents. Although the problem is NP-hard in general form, we incorporate recent results from the theory of finding shortest paths in time-dependent graphs to construct a polynomial-time algorithm that finds continuous trajectories in time-dependent flow fields. The algorithm has a hierarchical structure where a graph is constructed with time-varying edge costs that are derived from sets of continuous trajectories in the underlying flow field. We show that the continuous algorithm retains the time complexity and path quality properties of the discrete graph solution, and demonstrate its application to surface and underwater vehicles including a traversal along the East Australian Current with an autonomous marine vehicle. Results show that the algorithm performs efficiently in practice and can find paths that adapt to changing ocean currents. These results are significant to marine robotics because they allow for efficient use of time-varying ocean predictions for motion planning.

AB  - Navigation underwater traditionally is done by keeping a safe distance from obstacles, resulting in "fly-overs" of the area of interest. Movement of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through a cluttered space, such as a shipwreck or a decorated cave, is an extremely challenging problem that has not been addressed in the past. This paper proposes a novel navigation framework utilizing an enhanced version of Trajopt for fast 3D path-optimization planning for AUVs. A sampling-based correction procedure ensures that the planning is not constrained by local minima, enabling navigation through narrow spaces. Two different modalities are proposed: planning with a known map results in efficient trajectories through cluttered spaces; operating in an unknown environment utilizes the point cloud from the visual features detected to navigate efficiently while avoiding the detected obstacles. The proposed approach is rigorously tested, both on simulation and in-pool experiments, proven to be fast enough to enable safe real-time 3D autonomous navigation for an AUV.
