AB  - Fusions of LiDARs (light detection and ranging) and cameras have been effectively and widely employed in the communities of autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and mobile mapping systems (MMS) for different purposes, such as localization, high definition map or simultaneous location and mapping. However, the extrinsic calibration between a camera and a 3D LiDAR is a fundamental prerequisite to guarantee its performance. Some previous methods are inaccurate, have calibration error that is several times the beam divergence, and often require special calibration objects, thereby limiting their ubiquitous use for calibration. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel and high-accuracy method for the extrinsic calibration between a camera and a 3D LiDAR. Our approach relies on the infrared images from a camera with an infrared filter, and the 2D-3D corresponding points in a scene with the corners of a wall can be extracted to calculate the six extrinsic parameters. Experiments using the Velodyne VLP-16 sensor show that the method can achieve an extrinsic accuracy at the level of the beam divergence, which is fully analyzed and validated from two different aspects. Therefore, the calibration method in this paper is highly accurate, effective and does not require special complicated calibration objects; thus, it meets the requirements of practical applications.

AB  - As a crucial step of sensor data fusion, sensor calibration plays a vital role in many cutting-edge machine vision applications, such as autonomous vehicles and AR/VR. Existing techniques either require quite amount of manual work and complex settings, or are unrobust and prone to produce suboptimal results. In this paper, we investigate the extrinsic calibration of an RGB camera and a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor, which are two of the most widely used sensors in autonomous vehicles for perceiving the outdoor environment. Specifically, we introduce an online calibration technique that automatically computes the optimal rigid motion transformation between the aforementioned two sensors and maximizes their mutual information of perceived data, without the need of tuning environment settings. By formulating the calibration as an optimization problem with a novel calibration quality metric based on semantic features, we successfully and robustly align pairs of temporally synchronized camera and LiDAR frames in real time. Demonstrated on several autonomous driving tasks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art edge feature based auto-calibration approaches in terms of robustness and accuracy.

AB  - This work provides a framework for the 3D calibration of wafers and a wafer handling robot by monocular vision. The proposed method precisely reconstructs the 3D poses of wafers from a set of images captured by the camera mounted on the robot. In addition, it calibrates the robot kinematics simultaneously. A robust ellipse detection and tracking algorithm based on the edge arcs is developed to recognize wafers among images. Then a joint optimization is constructed from a multi-object pose graph to solve the 3D poses of wafers and other calibration parameters of the robot-camera system. The proposed tracking method is able to associate multiple incomplete elliptic segments using a Gaussian Mixture Model-based registration algorithm. The algorithm is point-based where no feature descriptor is required. The proposed 3D pose optimization incorporates shape constraints, and is more accurate than the point-wise reconstruction produced by classic bundle adjustment methods.

AB  - Taking selfies has become a photographic trend nowadays. We envision the emergence of the "video selfie" capturing a short continuous video clip (or burst photography) of the user, themselves. A selfie stick is usually used, whereby a camera is mounted on a stick for taking selfie photos. In this scenario, we observe that the camera typically goes through a special trajectory along a sphere surface. Motivated by this observation, in this work, we propose an efficient and globally optimal relative camera pose estimation between a pair of two images captured by a camera mounted on a selfie stick. We exploit the special geometric structure of the camera motion constrained by a selfie stick and define its motion as spherical joint motion. By the new parametrization and calibration scheme, we show that the pose estimation problem can be reduced to a 3-DoF (degrees of freedom) search problem, instead of a generic 6-DoF problem. This allows us to derive a fast branch-and-bound global optimization, which guarantees a global optimum. Thereby, we achieve efficient and robust estimation even in the presence of outliers. By experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we validate the performance as well as the guaranteed optimality of the proposed method.

AB  - The increasing availability of surround-view camera systems in passenger vehicles motivates their use as an exterior perception modality for intelligent vehicle behaviour. An important problem within this context is the extrinsic calibration between the cameras, which is challenging due to the often reduced overlap between the fields of view of neighbouring views. Our work is motivated by two insights. First, we argue that the accuracy of vision-based vehicle motion estimation depends crucially on the quality of exterior orientation calibration, while design parameters for camera positions typically provide sufficient accuracy. Second, we demonstrate how planar vehicle motion related direction vectors can be used to accurately identify individual camera-to-vehicle rotations, which are more useful than the commonly and tediously derived camera-to-camera transformations. We present a complete and highly practicable online optimisation strategy to obtain the exterior orientation parameters and conclude with successful tests on simulated, indoor, and large-scale outdoor experiments.

AB  - Self-diagnosis and self-repair are some of the key challenges in deploying robotic platforms for long-term real-world applications. One of the issues that can occur to a robot is miscalibration of its sensors due to aging, environmental transients, or external disturbances. Precise calibration lies at the core of a variety of applications, due to the need to accurately perceive the world. However, while a lot of work has focused on calibrating the sensors, not much has been done towards identifying when a sensor needs to be recalibrated. This paper focuses on a data-driven approach to learn the detection of miscalibration in vision sensors, specifically RGB cameras. Our contributions include a proposed miscalibration metric for RGB cameras and a novel semi-synthetic dataset generation pipeline based on this metric. Additionally, by training a deep convolutional neural network, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline to identify whether a recalibration of the camera's intrinsic parameters is required or not. The code is available at http://github.com/ethz-asl/camera_miscalib_detection.

AB  - The automatic parts feeding of multiple objects is an unsolved problem in the manufacturing industry. In this paper, we tackle the problem by proposing a multi-robot system. The system comprises three sub-components which perform bin-picking, regrasping, and kitting. The three subcomponents divide and conquer the automatic multiple parts feeding problem by considering a coarse-to-fine manipulation process. Multiple robot arms are connected in series as a pipeline. The robots are separated into three groups to perform the roles of each sub-component. The accuracy of the state and manipulation are getting higher along with the changes of the sub-components in the pipeline. In the experimental section, the performance of the system is evaluated by using the Mean Picks Per Hour (MPPH) metric and success rate, which are compared to traditional parts feeder and manual labor. The results show that the Mean Picks Per Hour (MPPH) of the proposed system is 351 with eleven various-shaped industrial parts, which is faster than the state-of-the-art robotic bin-picking system. The lead time of the proposed system for new parts is less than that of a traditional parts feeders and/or manual labor.

AB  - We consider the task of autonomously unloading boxes from trucks using an industrial manipulator robot. There are multiple challenges that arise: (1) real-time motion planning for a complex robotic system carrying two articulated mechanisms, an arm and a scooper, (2) decision-making in terms of what action to execute next given imperfect information about boxes such as their masses, (3) accounting for the sequential nature of the problem where current actions affect future state of the boxes, and (4) real-time execution that interleaves high-level decision-making with lower level motion planning. In this work, we propose a planning, learning, and reasoning framework to tackle these challenges, and describe its components including motion planning, belief space planning for offline learning, online decision-making based on offline learning, and an execution module to combine decision-making with motion planning. We analyze the performance of the framework on real-world scenarios. In particular, motion planning and execution modules are evaluated in simulation and on a real robot, while offline learning and online decision-making are evaluated in simulated real-world scenarios.

AB  - The latency in vision-based sensor systems used in human-robot collaborative environments is an important safety parameter which in most cases has been neglected by researchers. The main reason for this neglect is the lack of an accurate ground-truth sensor system with a minimal delay to benchmark the vision-sensors against. In this paper the latencies of 3D vision-based sensors are experimentally evaluated and analyzed using an accurate laser-tracker system which communicates on a dedicated EtherCAT channel with minimal delay. The experimental results in the paper demonstrate that the latency in the vision-based sensor system is many orders higher than the latency in the control and actuation system.

AB  - In industry assembly lines, parts feeding machines are widely employed as the prologue of the whole procedure. They play the role of sorting the parts randomly placed in bins to the state with specified pose. With the help of the parts feeding machines, the subsequent assembly processes by robot arm can always start from the same condition. Thus it is expected that function of parting feeding machine and the robotic assembly can be integrated with one robot arm. This scheme can provide great flexibility and can also contribute to reduce the cost. The difficulties involved in this scheme lie in the fact that in the part feeding phase, the pose of the part after grasping may be not proper for the subsequent assembly. Sometimes it can not even guarantee a stable grasp. In this paper, we proposed a method to integrate parts feeding and assembly within one robot arm. This proposal utilizes a specially designed gripper tip mounted on the jaws of a two-fingered gripper. With the modified gripper, in-hand manipulation of the grasped object is realized, which can ensure the control of the orientation and offset position of the grasped object. The proposal in this paper is verified by a simulated assembly in which a robot arm completed the assembly process including parts picking from bin and a subsequent peg-in-hole assembly.

AB  - In this paper we propose an algorithm to actively control the distance of a motor-propeller system (MPS) to a large obstacle using data from a single microphone. The method is based upon a broadband constructive/destructive interference pattern across the audible frequency band that is present when the MPS is near an obstacle. By taking the difference between the power spectrum in the obstacle-free case and the spectrum when recording near an obstacle, a broadband oscillation with respect to frequency is revealed. The frequency of this oscillation is linearly-related to the distance from the microphone to the wall. We present both static and dynamic experiments showcasing the ability of the proposed method to estimate the distance to a wall as well as actively control it.

Each X-joint is remotely actuated with cables and springs in parallel, thus realizing a tensegrity one-degree-of-freedom mechanism. As compared to manipulators built with simple revolute joints in series, manipulators with tensegrity X-joint offer a number of advantages, such as an intrinsic stability, variable stiffness and lower inertia. This new design was inspired by the musculosleketon architecture of the bird neck that is known to have remarkable features such as a high dexterity. The paper analyzes in detail the kinetostatics of a X-joint and proposes a 3-degree-of-freedom manipulator made of three such joints in series. Both simulation results and experiment results conducted on a test-bed prototype are presented and discussed.

AB  - This paper describes a new type of bending module inspired, in part, by the musculoskeletal structure of the lobster leg joint. The bending module proposed combines enhanced torque output, reconfigurability in assembling, safe compliant actuation, and accurate control on its mechanical performance. In this module, antagonistic soft chambers are enveloped by exoskeleton shells, and the bending angle and the stiffness can be independently adjusted by controlling the input pressure in the two chambers. Theoretical models are developed to characterize the relationships between the input pressure, bending angle, and stiffness, and a controller for angle control and stiffness tuning is constructed with experimental validation. The fabricated module can reach the maximum torque output of 109.7 N¬∑mm under 40 kPa and the stiffness range from 40 to 220 N¬∑mm/rad, demonstrating its capacity to fulfill both safe interactions and forceful tasks.

AB  - This paper presents a soft-robotic platform for exploring the ecological relevance of non-locomotory movements via animal-robot interactions. Coral snakes (genus Micrurus) and their mimics use vigorous, non-locomotory, and arrhythmic thrashing to deter predation. There is variation across snake species in the duration and curvature of anti-predator thrashes, and it is unclear how these aspects of motion interact to contribute to snake survival. In this work, soft robots composed of fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) are developed to emulate the anti-predator behaviors of three genera of snake. Curvature and duration of motion are estimated for both live snakes and robots, providing a quantitative assessment of the robots' ability to emulate snake poses. The curvature values of the fabricated soft-robotic head, midsection, and tail segments are found to overlap with those exhibited by live snakes. Soft robot motion durations were less than or equal to those of snakes for all three genera. Additionally, combinations of segments were selected to emulate three specific snake genera with distinct anti-predatory behavior, producing curvature values that aligned well with live snake observations.

AB  - The directional mechanical impedance of the human ankle was identified from subjects in a standing posture with varying levels of muscle activity. The impedance modeled the different torque responses to angle perturbations about different axes of rotation. This work proposed a novel impedance model that incorporated the coupling between multiple degrees of freedom of the ankle and was validated theoretically and experimentally. The reconstructed torque had an average variance accounted above 94% across twelve subjects. In addition, the impedance varied between and within trials and this variation was explained by changes in the ankle states, i.e., the ankle angle, torque, and muscle activities. These results have implications in the design of new prostheses controllers and the understanding of the human ankle function.

AB  - Legged systems need to optimize contact force in order to maintain contacts. For this, the controller needs to have the knowledge of the surface geometry and how slippery the terrain is. We can use a vision system to realize the terrain, but the accuracy of the vision system degrades in harsh weather, and it cannot visualize the terrain if it is covered with water or grass. Also, the degree of friction cannot be directly visualized. In this paper, we propose an online method to estimate the surface information via haptic exploration. We also introduce a probabilistic criterion to measure the quality of the estimation. The method is validated on both simulation and a real robot platform.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to present a method for simultaneous trajectory and local stabilizing policy optimization to generate local policies for trajectory-centric model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). This is motivated by the fact that global policy optimization for non-linear systems could be a very challenging problem both algorithmically and numerically. However, a lot of robotic manipulation tasks are trajectory-centric, and thus do not require a global model or policy. Due to inaccuracies in the learned model estimates, an open-loop trajectory optimization process mostly results in very poor performance when used on the real system. Motivated by these problems, we try to formulate the problem of trajectory optimization and local policy synthesis as a single optimization problem. It is then solved simultaneously as an instance of nonlinear programming. We provide some results for analysis as well as achieved performance of the proposed technique under some simplifying assumptions.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a method for generating undulatory gaits for snake robots. Instead of starting from a pre-defined movement pattern such as a serpenoid curve, we use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to automatically generate effective locomotion gaits via trajectory optimization. An important advantage of this approach is that the resulting gaits are automatically adapted to the environment that is being modeled as part of the snake dynamics. To illustrate this, we use a novel model for anisotropic dry friction, along with existing models for viscous friction and fluid dynamic effects such as drag and added mass. For each of these models, gaits generated without any change in the method or its parameters are as efficient as Pareto-optimal serpenoid gaits tuned individually for each environment. Furthermore, the proposed method can also produce more complex or irregular gaits, e.g. for obstacle avoidance or executing sharp turns.

AB  - With the increase in use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)/drones, it is important to detect and identify causes of failure in real time for proper recovery from a potential crash-like scenario or post incident forensics analysis. The cause of crash could be either a fault in the sensor/actuator system, a physical damage/attack, or a cyber attack on the drone's software. In this paper, we propose novel architectures based on deep Convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (CNNs and LSTMs) to detect (via Autoencoder) and classify drone mis-operations based on real-time sensor data. The proposed architectures are able to learn high-level features automatically from the raw sensor data and learn the spatial and temporal dynamics in the sensor data. We validate the proposed deep-learning architectures via simulations and realworld experiments on a drone. Empirical results show that our solution is able to detect (with over 90% accuracy) and classify various types of drone mis-operations (with about 99% accuracy (simulation data) and upto 85% accuracy (experimental data)).

AB  - Rapid and reliable robot bin picking is a critical challenge in automating warehouses, often measured in picks-per-hour (PPH). We explore increasing PPH using faster motions based on optimizing over a set of candidate grasps. The source of this set of grasps is two-fold: (1) grasp-analysis tools such as Dex-Net generate multiple candidate grasps, and (2) each of these grasps has a degree of freedom about which a robot gripper can rotate. In this paper, we present Grasp-Optimized Motion Planning (GOMP), an algorithm that speeds up the execution of a bin-picking robot's operations by incorporating robot dynamics and a set of candidate grasps produced by a grasp planner into an optimizing motion planner. We compute motions by optimizing with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and iteratively updating trust regions to account for the non-convex nature of the problem. In our formulation, we constrain the motion to remain within the mechanical limits of the robot while avoiding obstacles. We further convert the problem to a time-minimization by repeatedly shorting a time horizon of a trajectory until the SQP is infeasible. In experiments with a UR5, GOMP achieves a speedup of 9x over a baseline planner.

AB  - This paper presents a cooperative robotic team composed of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) with hybrid operational modes to tackle the multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP) with obstacles. The hybrid operational modes allow every UGV in the team to not only travel on a ground surface but also jump over obstacles. We name these UGVs jumping rovers. The jumping capability provides a flexible form of locomotion by leaping and landing on top of obstacles instead of navigating around obstacles. To solve the mTSP, an optimal path between any two objective points in an mTSP is determined by the optimized rapidly-exploring random tree method, named RRT*, and is further improved through a refined RRT* algorithm to find a smoother path between targets. We then formulate the mTSP as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem to search for the most cost-effective combination of paths for multiple UGVs. The effectiveness of the hybrid operational modes and optimized motion with assigned tasks is verified in an indoor, physical experimental environment using the customized jumping rovers.

AB  - Multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithms have been commonly used to model large-scale structures. When processing MVS, image acquisition is an important issue because its reconstruction quality depends heavily on the acquired images. Recently, an explore-then-exploit strategy has been used to acquire images for MVS. This method first constructs a coarse model by exploring an entire scene using a pre-allocated camera trajectory. Then, it rescans the unreconstructed regions from the coarse model. However, this strategy is inefficient because of the frequent overlap of the initial and rescanning trajectories. Furthermore, given the complete coverage of images, MVS algorithms do not guarantee an accurate reconstruction result.In this study, we propose a novel view path-planning method based on an online MVS system. This method aims to incrementally construct the target three-dimensional (3D) model in real time. View paths are continually planned based on online feedbacks from the partially constructed model. The obtained paths fully cover low-quality surfaces while maximizing the reconstruction performance of MVS. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can construct high quality 3D models with one exploration trial, without any rescanning trial as in the explore-then-exploit method.

AB  - This paper presents Reoriented Short-Cuts (RSC): A modification of the traditional Short-Cut technique, allowing almost sure, single homotopy class, asymptotic convergence in high degree of freedom (DoF) problems. An additional Informed Gaussian Sampling (IGS) technique is also introduced for convergence comparison. Traditionally, Short-Cut methods are used as a final technique to further optimize an initially found path. Typical Short-Cut methods fail as a single DoF may converge faster than the remaining, creating a zero-volume region between path segments and objects, halting further improvements. Previous attempts to solve this separate DoFs individually, drastically increasing collision checking computation. RSC and IGS control the shifting of the vertex to be Short-Cut, moving vertex positions by reorienting the line segments, removing the zero-volume convergence region. These methods are compared to similar strategies in a variety of problems including random worlds, and robot manipulation, to show the convergence across both translation and rotation oriented problems.

AB  - Deep reinforcement learning has great potential to acquire complex, adaptive behaviors for autonomous agents automatically. However, the underlying neural network polices have not been widely deployed in real-world applications, especially in these safety-critical tasks (e.g., autonomous driving). One of the reasons is that the learned policy cannot perform flexible and resilient behaviors as traditional methods to adapt to diverse environments. In this paper, we consider the problem that a mobile robot learns adaptive and resilient behaviors for navigating in unseen uncertain environments while avoiding collisions. We present a novel approach for uncertainty-aware navigation by introducing an uncertainty-aware predictor to model the environmental uncertainty, and we propose a novel uncertainty-aware navigation network to learn resilient behaviors in the prior unknown environments. To train the proposed uncertainty-aware network more stably and efficiently, we present the temperature decay training paradigm, which balances exploration and exploitation during the training process. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can learn resilient behaviors in diverse environments and generate adaptive trajectories according to environmental uncertainties.

AB  - Agile fixed-wing aircraft integrate the efficient, high-speed capabilities of conventional fixed-wing platforms with the extreme maneuverability of rotorcraft. This work presents a nonlinear control strategy that harnesses these capabilities to enable autonomous flight through aggressive, time-constrained, three-dimensional trajectories. The cascaded control structure consists of two parts; an inner attitude control loop developed on the Special Orthornormal group that avoids singularities commonly associated with other parametrizations, and an outer position control loop that jointly determines the thrust command and attitude references by implementing a novel vector-projection algorithm. The objective of the algorithm is to decouple roll from the reference attitude to ensure that thrust and lift forces can always be pointed such that position errors converge to zero. The proposed control system represents a single, unified solution that remains effective throughout the aircraft's flight envelope, including aerobatic operation. Controller performance is verified through simulations and experimental flight tests; results show the unified control scheme is capable of performing a wide range of operations that would normally require multiple, single-purpose controllers, and their associated switching logic.

AB  - Fixed-wing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft pose a unique control challenge that stems from complex aerodynamic interactions between wings and rotors. Thus, accurate estimation of external forces is indispensable for achieving high performance flight. In this paper, we present a composite adaptive nonlinear tracking controller for a fixed- wing VTOL. The method employs online adaptation of linear force models, and generates accurate estimation for wing and rotor forces in real-time based on information from a three-dimensional airflow sensor. The controller is implemented on a custom-built fixed-wing VTOL, which shows improved velocity tracking and force prediction during the transition stage from hover to forward flight, compared to baseline flight controllers.

AB  - In this paper we propose to control a quadrotor through direct acceleration feedback. The proposed method, while simple in form, alleviates the need for accurate estimation of platform parameters such as mass and propeller effectiveness. In order to use efficaciously the noisy acceleration measurements in direct feedback, we propose a novel regression-based filter that exploits the knowledge on the commanded propeller speeds, and extracts smooth platform acceleration with minimal delay. Our tests show that the controller exhibits a few millimeter error when performing real world tasks with fast changing mass and effectiveness, e.g., in pick and place operation and in turbulent conditions. Finally, we benchmark the direct acceleration controller against the PID strategy and show the clear advantage of using high-frequency and low-latency acceleration measurements directly in the control feedback, especially in the case of low frequency position measurements that are typical for real outdoor conditions.

AB  - This work presents a method to control omnidirectional micro aerial vehicles (OMAVs) for the tracking of 6-DoF trajectories in free space. A rigid body model based approach is applied in a receding horizon fashion to generate optimal wrench commands that can be constrained to meet limits given by the mechanical design and actuators of the platform. Allocation of optimal actuator commands is performed in a separate step. A disturbance observer estimates forces and torques that may arise from unmodeled dynamics or external disturbances and fuses them into the optimization to achieve offset-free tracking. Experiments on a fully overactuated MAV show the tracking performance and compare it against a classical PD-based controller.

AB  - This paper presents a design of oscillation damping control for the cable-Suspended Aerial Manipulator (SAM). The SAM is modeled as a double pendulum, and it can generate a body wrench as a control action. The main challenge is the fact that there is only one onboard IMU sensor which does not provide full information on the system state. To overcome this difficulty, we design a controller motivated by a simplified SAM model. The proposed controller is very simple yet robust to model uncertainties. Moreover, we propose a gain tuning rule by formulating the proposed controller in the form of output feedback linear quadratic regulation problem. Consequently, it is possible to quickly dampen oscillations with minimal energy consumption. The proposed approach is validated through simulations and experiments.

AB  - TUNERCAR is a toolchain that jointly optimizes racing strategy, planning methods, control algorithms, and vehicle parameters for an autonomous racecar. In this paper, we detail the target hardware, software, simulators, and systems infrastructure for this toolchain. Our methodology employs a parallel implementation of CMA-ES which enables simulations to proceed 6 times faster than real-world rollouts. We show our approach can reduce the lap times in autonomous racing, given a fixed computational budget. For all tested tracks, our method provides the lowest lap time, and relative improvements in lap time between 7-21%. We demonstrate improvements over a naive random search method with equivalent computational budget of over 15 seconds/lap, and improvements over expert solutions of over 2 seconds/lap. We further compare the performance of our method against hand-tuned solutions submitted by over 30 international teams, comprised of graduate students working in the field of autonomous vehicles. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of utilizing an online planning mechanism to reduce the reality gap between our simulation and actual tests.

AB  - Risk assessment to quantify the danger associated with taking a certain action is critical to navigating safely through crowded urban environments during autonomous driving. Risk assessment and subsequent planning is usually done by first tracking and predicting trajectories of other agents, such as vehicles and pedestrians, and then choosing an action to avoid future collisions. However, few existing risk assessment algorithms handle occlusion and other sensory limitations effectively. One either assesses the risk in the worst-case scenario and thus makes the ego vehicle overly conservative, or predicts as many hidden agents as possible and thus makes the computation intensive. This paper explores the possibility of efficient risk assessment under occlusion via both forward and backward reachability. The proposed algorithm can not only identify the location of risk-inducing factors, but can also be used during motion planning. The proposed method is evaluated on various four-way highly occluded intersections with up to five other vehicles in the scene. Compared with other risk assessment algorithms, the proposed method shows better efficiency, meaning that the ego vehicle reaches the goal at a higher speed. In addition, it also lowers the median collision rate by 7.5√ó when compared to state of the art techniques.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for implementing game theoretic decision making in combination with realistic sensory data input so as to allow an autonomous vehicle to perform maneuvers, such as lane change or merge in high traffic scenarios. The main novelty of this work, is the use of realistic sensory data input to obtain the observations as input of an iterative multi-player game in a realistic simulator. The game model allows to anticipate reactions of additional vehicles to the movements of the ego-vehicle without using any specific coordination or vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Moreover, direct information from the simulator, such as position or speed of the vehicles is also avoided.The solution of the game is based on cognitive hierarchy reasoning and it uses Monte Carlo reinforcement learning in order to obtain a near-optimal policy towards a specific goal. Moreover, the game proposed is capable of solving different situations using a single policy. The system has been successfully tested and compared with previous techniques using a realistic hybrid simulator, where the ego-vehicle and its sensors are simulated on a 3D simulator and the additional vehicles' behavior is obtained from a traffic simulator.

AB  - Traditional planning and control methods could fail to find a feasible trajectory for an autonomous vehicle to execute amongst dense traffic on roads. This is because the obstacle-free volume in spacetime is very small in these scenarios for the vehicle to drive through. However, that does not mean the task is infeasible since human drivers are known to be able to drive amongst dense traffic by leveraging the cooperativeness of other drivers to open a gap. The traditional methods fail to take into account the fact that the actions taken by an agent affect the behaviour of other vehicles on the road. In this work, we rely on the ability of deep reinforcement learning to implicitly model such interactions and learn a continuous control policy over the action space of an autonomous vehicle. The application we consider requires our agent to negotiate and open a gap in the road in order to successfully merge or change lanes. Our policy learns to repeatedly probe into the target road lane while trying to find a safe spot to move in to. We compare against two model-predictive control-based algorithms and show that our policy outperforms them in simulation. As part of this work, we introduce a benchmark for driving in dense traffic for use by the community.

AB  - In this paper, we consider a two-player racing game, where an autonomous ego vehicle has to be controlled to race against an opponent vehicle, which is either autonomous or human-driven. The approach to control the ego vehicle is based on a Sensitivity-ENhanced NAsh equilibrium seeking (SENNA) method, which uses an iterated best response algorithm in order to optimize for a trajectory in a two-car racing game. This method exploits the interactions between the ego and the opponent vehicle that take place through a collision avoidance constraint. This game-theoretic control method hinges on the ego vehicle having an accurate model and correct knowledge of the state of the opponent vehicle. However, when an accurate model for the opponent vehicle is not available, or the estimation of its state is corrupted by noise, the performance of the approach might be compromised. For this reason, we augment the SENNA algorithm by enforcing Permissive RObust SafeTy (PROST) conditions using control barrier functions. The objective is to successfully overtake or to remain in the front of the opponent vehicle, even when the information about the latter is not fully available. The successful synergy between SENNA and PROST-antithetical to the notable rivalry between the two namesake Formula 1 drivers-is demonstrated through extensive simulated experiments.

AB  - Visual place recognition is an important problem in mobile robotics which aims to localize a robot using image information alone. Recent methods have shown promising results for place recognition under varying environmental conditions by exploiting the sequential nature of the image acquisition process. We show that by using k nearest neighbours based image retrieval as the backend, and exploiting the structure of the image acquisition process which introduces temporal relations between images in the database, the location of possible matches can be restricted to a subset of all the images seen so far. In effect, the original problem space can thus be restricted to a significantly smaller subspace, reducing the inference time significantly. This is particularly important for scalable place recognition over databases containing millions of images. We present large scale experiments using publicly sourced data that show the computational performance of the proposed method under varying environmental conditions.

AB  - Globally localizing in a given map is a crucial ability for robots to perform a wide range of autonomous navigation tasks. This paper presents OneShot - a global localization algorithm that uses only a single 3D LiDAR scan at a time, while outperforming approaches based on integrating a sequence of point clouds. Our approach, which does not require the robot to move, relies on learning-based descriptors of point cloud segments and computes the full 6 degree-of-freedom pose in a map. The segments are extracted from the current LiDAR scan and are matched against a database using the computed descriptors. Candidate matches are then verified with a geometric consistency test. We additionally present a strategy to further improve the performance of the segment descriptors by augmenting them with visual information provided by a camera. For this purpose, a custom-tailored neural network architecture is proposed. We demonstrate that our LiDAR-only approach outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline on a sequence of the KITTI dataset and also evaluate its performance on the challenging NCLT dataset. Finally, we show that fusing in visual information boosts segment retrieval rates by up to 26% compared to LiDAR-only description.

AB  - Traditional robotic control suits require profound task-specific knowledge for designing, building and testing control software. The rise of Deep Learning has enabled end-to-end solutions to be learned entirely from data, requiring minimal knowledge about the application area. We design a learning scheme to train end-to-end linear dynamical systems (LDS)s by gradient descent in imitation learning robotic domains. We introduce a new regularization loss component together with a learning algorithm that improves the stability of the learned autonomous system, by forcing the eigenvalues of the internal state updates of an LDS to be negative reals. We evaluate our approach on a series of real-life and simulated robotic experiments, in comparison to linear and nonlinear Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures. Our results show that our stabilizing method significantly improves test performance of LDS, enabling such linear models to match the performance of contemporary nonlinear RNN architectures. A video of the obstacle avoidance performance of our method on a mobile robot, in unseen environments, compared to other methods can be viewed at https://youtu.be/mhEsCoNao5E.

AB  - We propose an online incremental learning approach through teleoperation which allows an operator to partially modify a learned model, whenever it is necessary, during task execution. Compared to conventional incremental learning approaches, the proposed approach is applicable for teleoperation-based teaching and it needs only partial demonstration without any need to obstruct the task execution. Dynamic authority distribution and kinesthetic coupling between the operator and the agent helps the operator to correctly perceive the exact instance where modification needs to be asserted in the agent's behaviour online using partial trajectory. For this, we propose a variation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for updating original model through mini batches of the modified partial trajectory. The proposed approach reduces human workload and latency for a rhythmic peg-in-hole teleoperation task where online partial modification is required during the task operation.

AB  - Lower leg prostheses could improve the life quality of amputees by increasing comfort and reducing energy to locomote, but currently control methods are limited in modulating behaviors based upon the human's experience. This paper describes the first steps toward learning complex controllers for dynamical robotic assistive devices. We provide the first example of behavioral cloning to control a powered transfemoral prostheses using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based recurrent neural network (RNN) running on a custom hardware accelerator that exploits temporal sparsity. The RNN is trained on data collected from the original prosthesis controller. The RNN inference is realized by a novel EdgeDRNN accelerator in real-time. Experimental results show that the RNN can replace the nominal PD controller to realize end-to-end control of the AMPRO3 prosthetic leg walking on flat ground and unforeseen slopes with comparable tracking accuracy. EdgeDRNN computes the RNN about 240 times faster than real time, opening the possibility of running larger networks for more complex tasks in the future. Implementing an RNN on this real-time dynamical system with impacts sets the ground work to incorporate other learned elements of the human-prosthesis system into prosthesis control.

AB  - Imitation learning enables robots to learn a task by simply watching the demonstration of the task. Current imitation learning methods usually require the learner and demonstrator to occur in the same context. This limits their scalability to practical applications. In this paper, we propose a more general imitation learning method which allows the learner and the demonstrator to come from different contexts, such as different viewpoints, backgrounds, and object positions and appearances. Specifically, we design a robotic system consisting of three models: context translation model, depth prediction model and multi-modal inverse dynamics model. First, the context translation model translates the demonstration to the context of learner from a different context. Then combining the color observation and depth observation as inputs, the inverse model maps the multi-modal observations into actions to reproduce the demonstration, where the depth observation is provided by a depth prediction model. By performing the block stacking tasks both in simulation and real world, we prove the cross-context learning advantage of the proposed robotic system over other systems.

AB  - Learning Assistance by Demonstration (LAD) is concerned with using demonstrations of a human agent to teach a robot how to assist another human. The concept has previously been used with smart wheelchairs to provide customised assistance to individuals with driving difficulties. A basic premise of this technique is that the learned assistive policy should be able to generalise to environments different than the ones used for training; but this has not been tested before. In this work we evaluate the assistive power and the generalisation capability of LAD using our custom teleoperation and learning system for smart wheelchairs, while seeking to improve it by experimenting with different combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and machine learning models. Using Autoencoders to reduce the dimension of laserscan data and a Gaussian Process as the learning model, we achieved a 23% improvement in prediction performance against the combination used by the latest work on the field. Using this model to assist a driver exposed to a simulated disability, we observed a 9.8% reduction in track completion times when compared to driving without assistance.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with human drivers. In order to facilitate interactive driving and cooperative behavior in dense traffic, a thorough understanding and representation of other traffic participants' behavior are necessary. Cost functions (or reward functions) have been widely used to describe the behavior of human drivers since they can not only explicitly incorporate the rationality of human drivers and the theory of mind (TOM), but also share similarity with the motion planning problem of autonomous vehicles. Hence, more human-like driving behavior and comprehensible trajectories can be generated to enable safer interaction and cooperation. However, the selection of cost functions in different driving scenarios is not trivial, and there is no systematic summary and analysis for cost function selection and learning from a variety of driving scenarios. In this work, we aim to investigate to what extent cost functions are suitable for explaining and imitating human driving behavior. Further, we focus on how cost functions differ from each other in different driving scenarios. Towards this goal, we first comprehensively review existing cost function structures in literature. Based on that, we point out required conditions for demonstrations to be suitable for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Finally, we use IRL to explore suitable features and learn cost function weights from human driven trajectories in three different scenarios.

AB  - A button battery accidentally ingested by a toddler or small child can cause severe damage to the stomach within a short period of time. Once a battery lands on the surface of the esophagus or stomach, it can run a current in the tissue and induce a chemical reaction resulting in injury. Following our previous work where we presented an ingestible magnetic robot for button battery retrieval, this study presents a remotely achieved novel localization method of a button battery with commonly available magnetic sensors (Hall-effect sensors). By applying a direct magnetic field to the button battery using an electromagnetic coil, the battery is magnetized, and hence it becomes able to be sensed by Hall-effect sensors. Using a trilateration method, we were able to detect the locations of an LR44 button battery and other ferromagnetic materials at variable distances. Additional four electromagnetic coils were used to autonomously navigate a magnet-containing capsule to dislocate the battery from the affected site.

AB  - This paper reports the development of a fully actuated body-mounted robotic assistant for MRI-guided low back pain injection. The robot is designed with a 4-DOF needle alignment module and a 2-DOF remotely actuated needle driver module. The 6-DOF fully actuated robot can operate inside the scanner bore during imaging; hence, minimizing the need of moving the patient in or out of the scanner during the procedure, and thus potentially reducing the procedure time and streamlining the workflow. The robot is built with a lightweight and compact structure that can be attached directly to the patient's lower back using straps; therefore, attenuating the effect of patient motion by moving with the patient. The novel remote actuation design of the needle driver module with beaded chain transmission can reduce the weight and profile on the patient, as well as minimize the imaging degradation caused by the actuation electronics. The free space positioning accuracy of the system was evaluated with an optical tracking system, demonstrating the mean absolute errors (MAE) of the tip position to be 0.99¬±0.46 mm and orientation to be 0.99¬±0.65¬∞. Qualitative imaging quality evaluation was performed¬± on a human volunteer, revealing minimal visible image degradation that should not affect the procedure. The mounting stability of the system was assessed on a human volunteer, indicating the 3D position variation of target movement with respect to the robot frame to be less than 0.7 mm.

AB  - It is known that the interior of the human body is one of the most adverse environments for a foreign body, such as an in-vivo robot, and vice-versa. As robots operating in-vivo are increasingly recognized for their capabilities and potential for improved therapies, it is important to ensure their safety, especially for long term treatments when little supervision can be provided. We introduce an implantable robot that is flexible, extendable and symmetric, thus changing shape and size. This design allows the implementation of an effective fault tolerant control, with features such as physical polling for fault diagnosis, retraction and redundancy-based control switching at fault. We demonstrate the fault-tolerant capabilities for an implantable robot that elongates tubular tissues by applying tension to the tissue. In benchtop tests, we show a reduction of the fault risks by at least 83%. The study provides a valuable methodology to enhance safety and efficacy of implantable and surgical robots, and thus to accelerate their adoption.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the effect of increasing camera baselines on depth perception in robot-assisted surgery. Restricted by the diameter of the surgical trocar through which they are inserted, current clinical stereo endoscopes have a fixed baseline of 5.5 mm. To overcome this restriction, we propose using a stereoscopic "pickup" camera with a side-firing design that allows for larger baselines. We conducted a user study with baselines of 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm to evaluate the effect of increasing baseline on depth perception when used with the da Vinci surgical system. Subjects (N=28) were recruited and asked to rank differently sized poles, mounted at a distance of 200 mm from the cameras, according to their increasing order of height when viewed under different baseline conditions. The results showed that subjects performed better as the baseline was increased with the best performance at a 20 mm baseline. This preliminary proof-of-concept study shows that there is opportunity to improve depth perception in robot-assisted surgical systems with a change in endoscope design philosophy. In this paper, we present this change with our side-firing "pickup" camera and its flexible baseline design. Ultimately, this serves as the first step towards an adaptive baseline camera design that maximizes depth perception in surgery.

AB  - Robotic automation has the potential to assist human surgeons in performing suturing tasks in microsurgery, and in order to do so a robot must be able to guide a needle with sub-millimeter precision through soft tissue. This paper presents a robotic suturing system that uses 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for imaging feedback. Calibration of the robot-OCT and robot-needle transforms, wound detection, keypoint identification, and path planning are all performed automatically. The calibration method handles pose uncertainty when the needle is grasped using a variant of iterative closest points. The path planner uses the identified wound shape to calculate needle entry and exit points to yield an evenly-matched wound shape after closure. Experiments on tissue phantoms and animal tissue demonstrate that the system can pass a suture needle through wounds with 0.200 mm overall accuracy in achieving the planned entry and exit points, and over 20√ó more precise than prior autonomous suturing robots.

AB  - Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has the advantage of reducing the invasiveness and pain of gastrointestinal examinations. In this work, we propose a system aimed at autonomously accelerating and locating the WCE inside the intestine for clinical applications. A rotating magnet controlled by a robotic arm is placed outside the patient's body to actuate the capsule with an internal magnetic ring, and the magnetic fields of the two sources are measured by an external sensor array. The original Multiple Objects Tracking method is improved by combining Normal Vector Fitting, B√©zier Curve Gradient, and Spherical Linear Interpolation to estimate the 6-D pose of the WCE from a 5-D pose sequence. In order to close the actuation-localization loop, a strategy is presented to react to different states of the capsule. The proposed method is validated via experiments on phantoms as well as on animal intestines. The localization of the capsule shows an accuracy of 3.5mm in position and 9.4¬∞ in orientation, and the average update frequency of the estimated 6-D pose reaches 25Hz.

AB  - Multi-legged robots are effective at traversing rough terrain. However, terrains that include collapsible footholds (i.e. regions that can collapse when stepped on) remain a significant challenge, especially since such situations can be extremely difficult to anticipate using only exteroceptive sensing. State-of-the-art methods typically use various stabilisation techniques to regain balance and counter changing footholds. However, these methods are likely to fail if safe footholds are sparse and spread out or if the robot does not respond quickly enough after a foothold collapse. This paper presents a novel method for multi-legged robots to probe and test the terrain for collapses using its legs while walking. The proposed method improves on existing terrain probing approaches, and integrates the probing action into a walking cycle. A follow-the-leader strategy with a suitable gait and stance is presented and implemented on a hexapod robot. The proposed method is experimentally validated, demonstrating the robot can safely traverse terrain containing collapsible footholds.

AB  - Multi-robot systems of increasing size and complexity are used to solve large-scale problems, such as area exploration and search and rescue. A key decision in human-robot teaming is dividing a multi-robot system into teams to address separate issues or to accomplish a task over a large area. In order to address the problem of selecting teams in a multi-robot system, we propose a new multimodal graph embedding method to construct a unified representation that fuses multiple information modalities to describe and divide a multi-robot system. The relationship modalities are encoded as directed graphs that can encode asymmetrical relationships, which are embedded into a unified representation for each robot. Then, the constructed multimodal representation is used to determine teams based upon unsupervised learning. We per-form experiments to evaluate our approach on expert-defined team formations, large-scale simulated multi-robot systems, and a system of physical robots. Experimental results show that our method successfully decides correct teams based on the multifaceted internal structures describing multi-robot systems, and outperforms baseline methods based upon only one mode of information, as well as other graph embedding-based division methods.

AB  - We present a multi-scale forward search algorithm for distributed agents to solve single-query shortest path planning problems. Each agent first builds a representation of its own search space of the common environment as a multi-resolution graph, it communicates with the other agents the result of its local search, and it uses received information from other agents to refine its own graph and update the local inconsistency conditions. As a result, all agents attain a common subgraph that includes a provably optimal path in the most informative graph available among all agents, if one exists, without necessarily communicating the entire graph. We prove the completeness and optimality of the proposed algorithm, and present numerical results supporting the advantages of the proposed approach.

AB  - Connectivity maintenance is an essential aspect to consider while controlling a multi-robot system. In general, a multi-robot system should be connected to obtain a certain common objective. Connectivity must be kept regardless of the control strategy or the objective of the multi-robot system. Two main methods exist for connectivity maintenance: keep the initial connections (local connectivity) or allow modifications to the initial connections, but always keeping the overall system connected (global connectivity). In this paper we present a method that allows, at the same time, to maintain global connectivity and to implement the desired control strategy (e.g., consensus, formation control, coverage), all in an optimized fashion. For this purpose, we defined and implemented a Control Barrier Function that can incorporate constraints and objectives. We provide a mathematical proof of the method, and we demonstrate its versatility with simulations of different applications.

AB  - The interplay between network topology and the interaction modalities of a multi-robot team fundamentally impact the types of formations that can be achieved. To explore the trade-offs between network structure and the sensing and communication capabilities of individual robots, this paper applies controller synthesis to formation control of infinitesimally shape-similar frameworks, for which maintaining the relative angles between robots ensures invariance of the framework to translation, rotation, and uniform scaling. Beginning with the development of a controller for the sole purpose of maintaining the formation, the controller-synthesis approach is introduced as a mechanism for incorporating user- designated objectives while ensuring that the formation is maintained. Both centralized and decentralized formulations of the synthesized controller are presented, the resulting sensing and communication requirements are discussed, and the method is demonstrated on a team of differential-drive robots.

Given the often critical nature of all the applications, it is important to reduce the amount of time necessary to accomplish this task through intelligent systems and algorithms. In this paper, we extend a previously presented algorithm based on source term estimation for odor source localization for homogeneous multi-robot systems. By gradually increasing the level of coordination among multiple mobile robots, we study the benefits of a distributed system on reducing the amount of time and resources necessary to achieve the task at hand. The method has been evaluated systematically through high-fidelity simulations and in a wind tunnel emulating realistic and repeatable conditions in different coordination scenarios and with different number of robots.

AB  - This paper introduces the Weighted Buffered Voronoi tessellation, which allows us to define distributed, semicooperative multi-agent navigation policies with guarantees on collision avoidance. We generate the Voronoi cells with dynamic weights that bias the boundary towards the agent with the lower relative weight while always maintaining a buffered distance between two agents. By incorporating agent weights, we can encode selfish or prioritized behavior among agents, where a more selfish agent will have a larger relative cell over less selfish agents. We consider this semi-cooperative since agents do not cooperate in symmetric ways. Furthermore, when all agents start in a collision-free configuration and plan their control actions within their cells, we prove that no agents will collide. Simulations demonstrate the performance of our algorithm for agents navigating to goal locations in a position-swapping game. We observe that agents with more egoistic weights consistently travel shorter paths to their goal than more altruistic agents.

Through a two stage approach: (1) an LSTM calibration routine is used to identify the current load state then (2) a control input generation step combines a generalized quasistatic model with the learned load model. Our experiments show that accounting for system load allows us to more accurately control tapered arm configurations. We analyze the performance of our method using soft robotic actuators and show it is capable of classifying between different arm configurations at a rate greater than 95%. Additionally, our method is capable of reducing the end-effector error of quasistatic model only control to within 1 cm of our controller baseline.

An SMA coil spring is embedded into a stretchable coolant vascular for soften structure of robots. In order to design a flexible, lightweight, and fast-response soft actuator with the SMA coil spring and coolant circulation system, a modeling based approach has been conducted. Analysis of coolant effects has been conducted in aspects of heating speed, cooling speed, and energy consumption based on both theoretical and empirical studies. From thermomechanical and heat transfer model between SMA and coolant, the actuation times in the case of heating and cooling phase have been estimated. From experimental results, Mineral oil is selected as the optimal coolant, and the maximum actuation frequency was measured as 0.5Hz for 40% contraction lifting 1kg.

The approach utilises a CycleGAN to close the reality gap between the simulated and real environments, in a reverse real-to-sim manner, effectively "tricking" the agent into believing it is still in the simulator. Furthermore, a visual servoing (VS) grasping task is added to correct for inaccurate agent gripper pose estimations derived from deep learning. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of real grasping experiments, achieving a success rate of 83 % on previously seen objects, and the same success rate for previously unseen, semi-compliant objects. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated by comparing it with two baselines, DRL plus CycleGAN, and VS only. The results clearly show that our approach outperforms both baselines.

AB  - Multi-arm mobile manipulators can be represented as a combination of multiple robotic agents from the perspective of task-assignment and motion planning. Depending upon the task, agents might collaborate or work independently. Integrating motion planning with task-agent assignment is a computationally slow process as infeasible assignments can only be detected through expensive motion planning queries. We present three speed-up techniques for addressing this problem-(1) spatial constraint checking using conservative surrogates for motion planners, (2) instantiating symbolic conditions for pruning infeasible assignments, and (3) efficiently caching and reusing previously generated motion plans. We show that the developed method is useful for real-world operations that require complex interaction and coordination among high-DOF robotic agents.

AB  - Learning contact-rich, robotic manipulation skills is a challenging problem due to the high-dimensionality of the state and action space as well as uncertainty from noisy sensors and inaccurate motor control. To combat these factors and achieve more robust manipulation, humans actively exploit contact constraints in the environment. By adopting a similar strategy, robots can also achieve more robust manipulation. In this paper, we enable a robot to autonomously modify its environment and thereby discover how to ease manipulation skill learning. Specifically, we provide the robot with fixtures that it can freely place within the environment. These fixtures provide hard constraints that limit the outcome of robot actions. Thereby, they funnel uncertainty from perception and motor control and scaffold manipulation skill learning. We propose a learning system that consists of two learning loops. In the outer loop, the robot positions the fixture in the workspace. In the inner loop, the robot learns a manipulation skill and after a fixed number of episodes, returns the reward to the outer loop. Thereby, the robot is incentivised to place the fixture such that the inner loop quickly achieves a high reward. We demonstrate our framework both in simulation and in the real world on three tasks: peg insertion, wrench manipulation and shallow- depth insertion. We show that manipulation skill learning is dramatically sped up through this way of scaffolding.

AB  - To solve multi-step manipulation tasks in the real world, an autonomous robot must take actions to observe its environment and react to unexpected observations. This may require opening a drawer to observe its contents or moving an object out of the way to examine the space behind it. Upon receiving a new observation, the robot must update its belief about the world and compute a new plan of action. In this work, we present an online planning and execution system for robots faced with these challenges. We perform deterministic cost-sensitive planning in the space of hybrid belief states to select likely-to-succeed observation actions and continuous control actions. After execution and observation, we replan using our new state estimate. We initially enforce that planner reuses the structure of the unexecuted tail of the last plan. This both improves planning efficiency and ensures that the overall policy does not undo its progress towards achieving the goal. Our approach is able to efficiently solve partially observable problems both in simulation and in a real-world kitchen.

Beyond filtering performance, the main interests of the approach are its versatility, as the method applies to numerous state estimation problems, and its simplicity of implementation for practitioners not being necessarily familiar with manifolds and Lie groups. We have developed the method on two independent open-source Python and Matlab frameworks we call UKF-M, for quickly implementing and testing the approach. The online repositories contain tutorials, documentation, and various relevant robotics examples that the user can readily reproduce and then adapt, for fast prototyping and benchmarking.

AB  - For most applications in mobile robotics, precise state estimation is essential. Typically, the state estimation is based on the fusion of data from different sensors. In practice, these sensors differ in their characteristics and measurements are available to the sensor fusion algorithm only with delay. Based on a brief survey of sensor fusion approaches that consider delayed and out-of-sequence availability of measurements, suitable approaches for applications in mobile robotics are identified. In a consumer robot use-case, experiments show that the estimation is biased if delayed availability of measurements is not considered appropriately. However, if delays are considered in the fusion process, the estimation bias is reduced to almost zero and in consequence, the estimation performance is distinctly improved. Two computational favorable approximative methods are described and provide almost the same accuracy as - theoretically optimal - brute-force filter recalculation at much lower and well-distributed computational costs.

AB  - The fusion of multiple sensor modalities, especially through deep learning architectures, has been an active area of study. However, an under-explored aspect of such work is whether the methods can be robust to degradation across their input modalities, especially when they must generalize to degradation not seen during training. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware fusion scheme to effectively fuse inputs that might suffer from a range of known and unknown degradation. Specifically, we analyze a number of uncertainty measures, each of which captures a different aspect of uncertainty, and we propose a novel way to fuse degraded inputs by scaling modality-specific output softmax probabilities. We additionally propose a novel data-dependent spatial temperature scaling method to complement these existing uncertainty measures. Finally, we integrate the uncertainty-scaled output from each modality using a probabilistic noisy-or fusion method. In a photo-realistic simulation environment (AirSim), we show that our method achieves significantly better results on a semantic segmentation task, as compared to state-of-art fusion architectures, on a range of degradation (e.g. fog, snow, frost, and various other types of noise), some of which are unknown during training.

AB  - In this paper, we present an efficient and robust GPS-aided visual inertial odometry (GPS-VIO) system that fuses IMU-camera data with intermittent GPS measurements. To perform sensor fusion, spatiotemporal sensor calibration and initialization of the transform between the sensor reference frames are required. We propose an online calibration method for both the GPS-IMU extrinsics and time offset as well as a reference frame initialization procedure that is robust to GPS sensor noise. In addition, we prove the existence of four unobservable directions of the GPS-VIO system when estimating in the VIO reference frame, and advocate a state transformation to the GPS reference frame for full observability. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach in Monte-Carlo simulations where we investigate the system's robustness to different levels of GPS noise and loss of GPS signal, and additionally study the hyper-parameters used in the initialization procedure. Finally, the proposed system is validated in a large-scale real-world experiment.

AB  - To fuse information from inertial measurement units (IMU) with other sensors one needs an accurate model for IMU error propagation in terms of position, velocity and orientation, a triplet we call extended pose. In this paper we leverage a nontrivial result, namely log-linearity of inertial navigation equations based on the recently introduced Lie group SE2(3), to transpose the recent methodology of Barfoot and Furgale for associating uncertainty with poses (position, orientation) of SE(3) when using noisy wheel speeds, to the case of extended poses (position, velocity, orientation) of SE2(3) when using noisy IMUs. Besides, our approach to extended poses combined with log-linearity property allows revisiting the theory of preintegration on manifolds and reaching a further theoretic level in this field. We show exact preintegration formulas that account for rotating Earth, that is, centrifugal force and Coriolis effect, may be derived as a byproduct.

We combine measurements from a millimeter-wave radar-on-a-chip sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) in a batch optimization over a sliding window of recent measurements. The sensor suite employed is lightweight, low-power, and is invariant to ambient lighting conditions. This makes the proposed approach an attractive solution for platforms with limitations around payload and longevity, such as aerial vehicles conducting autonomous exploration in perceptually degraded operating conditions, including subterranean environments. We compare our radar-inertial velocity estimates to those from a visual-inertial (VI) approach. We show the accuracy of our method is comparable to VI in conditions favorable to VI, and far exceeds the accuracy of VI when conditions deteriorate.

AB  - This paper presents the design of a compliant manipulator using a series elastic actuator (SEA) and a mechanism for precisely measuring the force acting on the contact part of the manipulator without using a force sensor. It is important to maintain a constant contact force between the compliant manipulator and the wall in order to guarantee cleaning performance, and the ball screw mechanism is used to adapt to changes in the distance and the angle. Position-based impedance control is used to maintain a constant contact force when the manipulator interacts with the wall of the building, and the results confirm that the system stability is guaranteed when using SEA, regardless of the variation in the actual stiffness of the manipulator. The results of extensive experimentation using the test bench demonstrate the force tracking performance against various types of wall changes using the stiff wet-type cleaning manipulator. The results indicate that the stiffness of SEA affects the force tracking performance and system stability under the condition of the manipulator and environment interaction, and that the system stability and control performance can be improved by applying a robust force measurement mechanism to noise.

AB  - We present an approach for the autonomous, robust execution of peg-in-hole assembly tasks. We build on a sampling-based state estimation framework, in which samples are weighted according to their consistency with the position and joint torque measurements. The key idea is to reuse these samples in a motion generation step, where they are assigned a second task-specific weight. The algorithm thereby guides the peg towards the goal along the configuration space. An advantage of the approach is that the user only needs to provide: the geometry of the objects as mesh data, as well as a rough estimate of the object poses in the workspace, and a desired goal state. Another advantage is that the local, online nature of our algorithm leads to robust behavior under uncertainty. The approach is validated in the case of our robotic setup and under varying uncertainties for the classical peg-in-hole problem subject to two different geometries.

We show that, by modifying the error reduction function and evaluating the function bounds associated with friction, the procedures developed for frictionless contact apply to the frictional cases. Thus, for bounded misalignments, if an admittance satisfies the misalignment-reducing conditions at a finite number of contact configurations, then the admittance will also satisfy the conditions at all intermediate configurations for any value of friction less than the specified upper bound.

AB  - Actuators are essential devices that exert force and do work. The contraction of an actuator (how much it can shorten) is an important property that strongly influences its applications, especially in engineering and robotics. While high contractions have been achieved by thermally- or fluidically-driven technologies, electrically-driven actuators typically cannot contract by more than 50%. Recently developed electro-ribbon actuators are simple, low cost, scalable electroactive devices powered by dielectrophoretic liquid zipping (DLZ) that exhibit high efficiency (~70%), high power equivalent to mammalian muscle (~100 W/kg), contractions exceeding 99%. We characterise the electro-ribbon actuator and explore contraction variation with voltage and load. We describe the unique self-locking behaviour of the electro-ribbon actuator which could allow for low-power-consumption solenoids and valves. Finally, we show the interdependence of constituent material properties and the important role that material choice plays in maximising performance.

AB  - Supercoiled polymer (SCP) artificial muscles exhibit many desirable properties such as large contractions and high power density. However, their full potential as robotic muscles is challenged by insufficient strain or force generation - non-mandrel-coiled SCP actuators produce up to 10-20% strain; mandrel-coiled SCP actuators often lift up to 10-30g of weight. It is strongly desired but difficult to obtain SCP actuators that produce large strain and large force. In this paper, the design, characterization, and modeling of helically wrapped SCP (HW-SCP) actuators are presented, which can produce up to 40-60% strain and lift more than 90g of weight. By adjusting their configuration parameters, their strain and force performance can be changed. Experiments are conducted to characterize the force production, strain, and speed of HW-SCP actuators. A Preisach hysteresis model and a polynomial model are adopted to accurately capture the actuator behaviors. This work contributes to high-performance artificial muscles.

AB  - Soft continuum robots have many applications such as medical surgeries, service industries, rescue tasks, and underwater exploration. Flexibility and good accessibility of such robots are the key reasons for their popularity. However, the complexity of their structural design and control systems limit their broader applications. In this paper, a novel variable stiffness soft continuum robot based on pre-charged air, particle jamming, and origami is proposed. The robot is a bellow-like origami structure with internal chambers. A spine-like chamber is filled with particles, and three identical chambers surrounding the spine chamber are filled with pressurized air. When the origami structure is compressed, the particles are jammed by the compression force and the increased pressure of the three air chambers, thus increasing the overall stiffness of the robot. The robot expansion-contraction and bending are controlled by three tendons. An analytical model of the proposed stiffness variation mechanism has been developed. The effects of various parameters on the lateral and axial stiffness of the soft continuum robot have been investigated by experimental studies. A prototype robot has been fabricated to demonstrate grasping operations.

AB  - SwarmRail represents a novel solution to overhead manipulation from a mobile unit that drives in an aboveground rail-structure. The concept is based on the combination of omnidirectional mobile platform and L-shaped rail profiles that form a through-going central gap. This gap makes possible mounting a robotic manipulator arm overhead at the underside of the mobile platform. Compared to existing solutions, SwarmRail enables continuous overhead manipulation while traversing rail crossings. It also can be operated in a robot swarm, as it allows for concurrent operation of a group of mobile SwarmRail units inside a single rail network. Experiments on a first functional demonstrator confirm the functional capability of the concept. Potential fields of applications reach from industry over logistics to vertical farming.

We combine obstacle detection along with a terrain gradient map to make simple and adaptable cost map. This map can be created and updated at 10 Hz. An A* planner finds optimal paths over the map. Finally, we take multiple samples over the control input space and do a kinematic forward simulation to generated feasible trajectories. Then the most optimal trajectory, as determined by the cost map and proximity to A* path, is chosen and sent to the controller. Our method allows real time operation at rates of 30 Hz. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in various off-road terrain at high speed.

AB  - Autonomous robots often encounter challenging situations where their control policies fail and an expert human operator must briefly intervene, e.g., through teleoperation. In settings where multiple robots act in separate environments, a single human operator can manage a fleet of robots by identifying and teleoperating one robot at any given time. The key challenge is that users have limited attention: as the number of robots increases, users lose the ability to decide which robot requires teleoperation the most. Our goal is to automate this decision, thereby enabling users to supervise more robots than their attention would normally allow for. Our insight is that we can model the user's choice of which robot to control as an approximately optimal decision that maximizes the user's utility function. We learn a model of the user's preferences from observations of the user's choices in easy settings with a few robots, and use it in challenging settings with more robots to automatically identify which robot the user would most likely choose to control, if they were able to evaluate the states of all robots at all times. We run simulation experiments and a user study with twelve participants that show our method can be used to assist users in performing a simulated navigation task. We also run a hardware demonstration that illustrates how our method can be applied to a real-world mobile robot navigation task.

AB  - In human-robot collaboration, it is crucial for the robot to make its intentions clear and predictable to the human partners. Inspired by the mutual learning and adaptation of human partners, we suggest an actor-critic approach for a legible robot motion planner. This approach includes two neural networks and a legibility evaluator: 1) A policy network based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL); 2) A Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) based sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model as a motion predictor; 3) A legibility evaluator that maps motion to legible reward. Through a series of human-subject experiments, we demonstrate that with a simple handicraft function and no real-human data, our method lead to improved collaborative performance against a baseline method and a non-prediction method.

We propose and validate a pragmatic solution based on a push button acting as a simple additional input device which switches between different virtual workspace surfaces. Results of a study involving ten subjects show that the approach performs well on a challenging 3D piloting task, where it compares favorably with joystick control.

AB  - Aiming to understand how human (false-)belief- a core socio-cognitive ability-would affect human interactions with robots, this paper proposes to adopt a graphical model to unify the representation of object states, robot knowledge, and human (false-)beliefs. Specifically, a parse graph (pg) is learned from a single-view spatiotemporal parsing by aggregating various object states along the time; such a learned representation is accumulated as the robot's knowledge. An inference algorithm is derived to fuse individual pg from all robots across multi-views into a joint pg, which affords more effective reasoning and inference capability to overcome the errors originated from a single view. In the experiments, through the joint inference over pgs, the system correctly recognizes human (false-)belief in various settings and achieves better cross-view accuracy on a challenging small object tracking dataset.

AB  - Newborn infants are naturally attracted to human faces, a crucial source of information for social interaction. In robotics, acquisition of such information is crucial and social robots should also learn to exhibit such social skill. Deep learning algorithms are valid candidates to address the problem of face localisation. However, a major drawback of these methods is the large amount of data and human supervision needed in the training procedure. In this work, we propose a cognitive architecture to address autonomous learning from raw sensory signals without supervision. We demonstrate the success of our cognitive framework for the task of face localisation. The proposed cognitive architecture builds on existing work and uses audiovisual attention and a proactive stereo vision mechanism to autonomously direct a robot's attentive focus towards human faces. The gathered information is used to incrementally generate a dataset that can be used to train a state-of-the-art deep network. The learning system imitates the typical learning process of infants and enhances the learning generalization process by leveraging on the interaction experience with people. The integration of HRI with machine learning, inspired by early development in humans, constitutes an innovative approach for improving autonomous learning in robots.

AB  - Maintaining high levels of productivity for planetary rover missions is very difficult due to limited communication and heavy reliance on ground control. There is a need for autonomy that enables more adaptive and efficient actions based on real-time information. This paper presents an autonomous mapping and exploration approach for planetary rovers. We first describe a machine learning model that actively combines remote and rover measurements for mapping. We focus on spectroscopic data because they are commonly used to investigate surface composition. We then incorporate notions from information theory and non-myopic path planning to improve exploration productivity. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and successful performance of our approach via spectroscopic investigations of Cuprite, Nevada; a well-studied region of mineralogical and geological interest. We first perform a detailed analysis in simulations, and then validate those results with an actual rover in the field in Nevada.

AB  - The autonomous operation of robots in the International Space Station (ISS) is required to maximize the use of limited resources and enable astronauts to concentrate more on valuable tasks. To achieve these goals, we are developing a station where the robot approaches, docks, charges, and then undocks. In this paper, the authors propose a magnetic docking mechanism for free-flying robots with spherical surfaces that makes it possible for a robot to dock securely without requiring highly precise guidance, navigation and control capability. By making use of a slider guide and repelling pairs of magnets, this mechanism can achieve tolerance for larger robot position error as compared with the conventional fixed guide mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively enlarge the acceptable error range of poses, and also reduce acceleration at the moment of impact. We also introduce a model to predict the success or failure of docking from the contact condition of the robot and the guide by using a machine learning technique - Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The prediction results shows that the learnt model can express the contact condition of successful docking.

AB  - In this work, we demonstrate an instrumented wheel concept which utilizes a 2D pressure grid, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) sensor and machine learning (ML) to extract meaningful metrics from the interaction between the wheel and surface terrain. These include continuous slip/skid estimation, balance, and sharpness for engineering applications. Estimates of surface hydration, texture, terrain patterns, and regolith physical properties such as cohesion and angle of internal friction are additionally calculated for science applications. Traditional systems rely on post-processing of visual images and vehicle telemetry to estimate these metrics. Through in-situ sensing, these metrics can be calculated in near real time and made available to onboard science and engineering autonomy applications. This work aims to provide a deployable system for future planetary exploration missions to increase science and engineering capabilities through increased knowledge of the terrain.

AB  - On-orbit proximity operations in space rendezvous, docking and debris removal require precise and robust 6D pose estimation under a wide range of lighting conditions and against highly textured background, i.e., the Earth. This paper investigates leveraging deep learning and photorealistic rendering for monocular pose estimation of known uncooperative spacecraft. We first present a simulator built on Unreal Engine 4, named URSO, to generate labeled images of spacecraft orbiting the Earth, which can be used to train and evaluate neural networks. Secondly, we propose a deep learning framework for pose estimation based on orientation soft classification, which allows modelling orientation ambiguity as a mixture model. This framework was evaluated both on URSO datasets and the European Space Agency pose estimation challenge. In this competition, our best model achieved 3rd place on the synthetic test set and 2nd place on the real test set. Moreover, our results show the impact of several architectural and training aspects, and we demonstrate qualitatively how models learned on URSO datasets can perform on real images from space.

AB  - To control a free-floating robotic system with uncertain parameters in OOS tasks with high accuracy, a fast parameter identification method, previously developed by the authors, is enhanced further and used concurrently with a controller. The method provides accurate parameter estimates, without any prior knowledge of any system dynamic properties. This control scheme compensates for the accumulated angular momentum on the reaction wheels (RWs), which acts as a disturbance to the robotic servicer base. While any controller using parameter information can be used, a transposed Jacobian controller, modified to include RW angular momentum disturbance rejection, is employed here. Threedimensional simulations demonstrate the method's validity.

AB  - The performance of model-based motion control for free-flying robots relies on accurate estimation of their parameters. In this work, a method of rigid body inertial parameter estimation which relies on a variational approach is presented. Instead of discretizing the continuous equations of motion, discrete dual quaternion equations based on variational mechanics are used to formulate a linear parameter estimation problem. This method depends only on the pose of the rigid body obtained from standard localization algorithms. Recursive semi-definite programming is used to estimate the inertial parameters (mass, rotational inertia and center of mass offset) online. Linear Matrix Inequality constraints based on the pseudo-inertia matrix ensure that the estimates obtained are fully physically consistent. Simulation results demonstrate that this method is robust to disturbances and the produced estimates are at least one order of magnitude more accurate when compared to discretization using finite differences.

AB  - Many approaches for camera and LiDAR calibration are presented in literature but none of them estimates all intrinsic and extrinsic parameters simultaneously and therefore optimally in a probabilistic sense.In this work, we present a method to simultaneously estimate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of cameras and LiDARs in a unified problem. We derive a probabilistic formulation that enables flawless integration of different measurement types without hand-tuned weights. An arbitrary number of cameras and LiDARs can be calibrated simultaneously. Measurements are not required to be time-synchronized. The method is designed to work with any camera model.In evaluation, we show that additional LiDAR measurements significantly improve intrinsic camera calibration. Further, we show on real data that our method achieves state-of-the-art calibration precision with high reliability.

AB  - In order to relate information across cameras in a Dynamic Camera Cluster (DCC), an accurate time-varying set of extrinsic calibration transformations need to be determined. Previous calibration approaches rely solely on collecting measurements from a known fiducial target which limits calibration accuracy as insufficient excitation of the gimbal is achieved. In this paper, we improve DCC calibration accuracy by collecting measurements over the entire configuration space of the gimbal and achieve a 10X improvement in pixel re-projection error. We perform a joint optimization over the calibration parameters between any number of cameras and unknown joint angles using a pose-loop error optimization approach, thereby avoiding the need for overlapping fields-of-view. We test our method in simulation and provide a calibration sensitivity analysis for different levels of camera intrinsic and joint angle noise. In addition, we provide a novel analysis of the degenerate parameters in the calibration when joint angle values are unknown, which avoids situations in which the calibration cannot be uniquely recovered. The calibration code will be made available at https://github.com/TRAILab/AC-DCC.

AB  - Planarity of checkerboards is a widely used feature for extrinsic calibration of camera and LiDAR. In this study, we propose two analytically derived covariances of (i) plane parameters and (ii) plane measurement, for precise extrinsic calibration of camera and LiDAR. These covariances allow the graded approach in planar feature correspondences by exploiting the uncertainty of a set of given features in calibration. To construct plane parameter covariance, we employ the error model of 3D corner points and the analytically formulated plane parameter errors. Next, plane measurement covariance is directly derived from planar regions of point clouds using the out-of-plane errors. In simulation validation, our method is compared to an existing uncertainty-excluding method using the different number of target poses and the different levels of noise. In field experiment, we validated the applicability of the proposed analytic plane covariances for precise calibration using the basic planarity-based method and the latest planarity-and-linearity-based method.

AB  - Industrial arm-type robots have multiple degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) and high dexterity but the use of the roll-pitch-roll wrist configuration yields singularities inside the reachable workspace. Excessive joint velocities will occur when encountering these singularities. Arm-type robots currently don't have enough dexterity to move the end-effector path away from the wrist singularities. Robots with redundant DoFs can be used to provide additional dexterity to avoid the singularities and reduce the excessive joint velocity. An end-effector wrist module is proposed to provide two redundant DoFs when interfaced with an existing 6-DoF robot. The new 8-DoF robot has a compact roll-pitch-yaw wrist that has no singularities inside the reachable workspace. The highly redundant robot can also be used to avoid collisions in various directions. Path tracking simulation examples are provided to show the advantages of the proposed design when compared with existing redundant or nonredundant robots. We expect that this module can serve as a cost-effective solution in applications where singularity-free motion or collision-free motion is required.

The motion planning problem for such systems was rarely addressed due to the complex nonlinear dynamics. A simulation-based prediction method is proposed to easily handle the complicated nonlinear dynamics and efficiently generate the obstacle-free and dynamically feasible trajectories. The vehicle dynamics model and a two-layer controller are used in the prediction. Implementation results on the real-world full-size industrial tractor-trailers vehicle are presented to validate the performance of the proposed methods.

AB  - Scalability is a significant challenge for robot swarms. Generally, larger groups of cooperating robots produce more inter-robot collisions, and in swarm robot foraging, larger search arenas result in larger travel costs. This paper demonstrates a scale-invariant swarm foraging algorithm that ensures that each robot finds and delivers targets to a central collection zone at the same rate regardless of the size of the swarm or the search area. Dispersed mobile depots aggregate locally collected targets and transport them to a central place via a hierarchical branching transportation network. This approach is inspired by ubiquitous fractal branching networks such as tree branches and animal cardiovascular networks that deliver resources to cells and determine the scale and pace of life. We demonstrate that biological scaling laws predict how quickly robots forage in simulations of up to thousands of robots searching over thousands of square meters. We then use biological scaling to predict the capacity of depot robots that overcome scaling constraints to produce scale-invariant robot swarms. We verify the claims for large swarms in simulation and implement a simple depot design in hardware.

AB  - Advances in legged robotics are strongly rooted in animal observations. A clear illustration of this claim is the generalization of Central Pattern Generators (CPG), first identified in the cat spinal cord, to generate cyclic motion in robotic locomotion. Despite a global endorsement of this model, physiological and functional experiments in mammals have also indicated the presence of descending signals from the cerebellum, and reflex feedback from the lower limb sensory cells, that closely interact with CPGs. To this day, these interactions are not fully understood. In some studies, it was demonstrated that pure reflex-based locomotion in the absence of oscillatory signals could be achieved in realistic musculoskeletal simulation models or small compliant quadruped robots. At the same time, biological evidence has attested the functional role of the cerebellum for predictive control of balance and stance within mammals. In this paper, we promote both approaches and successfully apply reflex-based dynamic locomotion, coupled with a balance and gravity compensation mechanism, on the state-of-art HyQ robot. We discuss the importance of this stability module to ensure a correct foot lift-off and maintain a reliable gait. The robotic platform is further used to test two different architectural hypotheses inspired by the cerebellum. An analysis of experimental results demonstrates that the most biologically plausible alternative also leads to better results for robust locomotion.

AB  - Neuromorphic hardware offers computing platforms for the efficient implementation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) that can be used for robot control. Here, we present such an SNN on a neuromorphic chip that solves a number of tasks related to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM): forming a map of an unknown environment and, at the same time, estimating the robot's pose. In particular, we present an SNN mechanism to detect and estimate errors when the robot revisits a known landmark and updates both the map and the path integration speed to reduce the error. The whole system is fully realized in a neuromorphic device, showing the feasibility of a purely SNN-based SLAM, which could be efficiently implemented in a small form-factor neuromorphic chip.

AB  - In this study, a visual shock absorber capable of adapting to free-fall objects with various weights and speeds is designed and realized. The key element is a magnetic gear to passively absorb shock in the moment of contact, which is difficult for traditional feedback control to deal with. The magnetic gear allows the seamless transfer of control from the non-contact state to the contact state. 1000 Hz high-speed visual object tracking is used for preparation with position and velocity control in the object non-contact state. In the moment of object contact, the high backdrivability of the magnetic gear response by hardware provides high responsiveness to external force. After the impact, the plastic deformation control of a parallel-expressed Maxwell model handles the contact state.

AB  - Path following accuracy and error convergence with graceful motion in vehicle steering control is challenging due to the competing nature of these requirements, especially across a range of operating speeds. This work is founded upon slip-based kinematic and dynamic models, which allow derivation of controllers considering error due to sideslip and the mapping between steering commands and graceful lateral motion. A novel recursive backstepping steering controller is proposed that better couples yaw-rate based path following commands to steering angle and rate. Observer based sideslip estimates are combined with heading error in the kinematic controller to provide feedforward slip compensation. Path following error is compensated by a Variable Structure Controller (VSC) to balance graceful motion, path following error, and robustness. Yaw rate commands are used by a backstepping dynamic controller to generate robust steering commands. A High Gain Observer (HGO) estimates sideslip and yaw rate for output feedback control. Stability analysis is provided and peaking is addressed. Field experimental results evaluate the work and provide comparisons to MPC.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of fast and safe autonomous navigation in partially known environments. Our main contribution is a control policy design based on ellipsoidal trajectory bounds obtained from a quadratic state-dependent distance metric. The ellipsoidal bounds are used to embed directional preference in the control design, leading to system behavior that is adapted to local environment geometry, carefully considering medial obstacles while paying less attention to lateral ones. We use a virtual reference governor system to adaptively follow a desired navigation path, slowing down when system safety may be violated and speeding up otherwise. The resulting controller is able to navigate complex environments faster than common Euclidean-norm and Lyapunov-function-based designs, while retaining stability and collision avoidance guarantees.

AB  - Series elastic actuators with passive compliance have been gaining increasing popularity in force-controlled robotic manipulators. One of the reasons is the actuator's ability to infer the applied torque by measuring the deflection of the elastic element as opposed to directly with dedicated torque sensors. Proper deflection control is pinnacle to achieve a desired output torque and, therefore, small deviances in positional measurements or a nonlinear deformation can have adverse effects on performance. In applications with larger torque requirements, the actuators typically use gear reductions which inherently result in mechanical backlash. This combined with the nonlinear behaviour of the elastic element and unmodelled dynamics, can severely compromise force fidelity.This paper proposes a backlash compensating active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) for multi-input series elastic actuators. In addition to proper deflection control, a multiinput active disturbance rejection controller is derived and implemented experimentally to mitigate any unmodelled nonlinearities or perturbations to the plant model. The controller is experimentally validated on a hybrid motor-brake-clutch series elastic actuator and the controller performance is compared against traditional error-based controllers. It is shown that the backlash compensated ADRC outperforms classical PID and ADRC methods and is a viable solution to positional measurement error in elastic actuators.

AB  - A novel scheme for an "upgrade" of a linear control algorithm to a non-linear one is developed based on the concepts of a generalized homogeneity and an implicit homogeneous feedback design. Some tuning rules for a guaranteed improvement of a regulation quality are proposed. Theoretical results are confirmed by real experiments with the quadrotor QDrone of Quanser‚Ñ¢.
