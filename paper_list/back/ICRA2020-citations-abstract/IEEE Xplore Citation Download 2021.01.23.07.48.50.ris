AB  - To detach a permanent magnet using a control force much smaller than its original attractive force, the internally-balanced magnetic unit (IB Magnet) was invented. It has been applied to magnetic devices such as wall-climbing robots, ceiling-dangling drones, and modular swarm robots. In contrast to its significant reduction rate with regard to the control force, the IB Magnet has two major problems in its nonlinear spring, which serves the purpose of cancelling out the internal force on the magnet. These problems include the complicated design procedure and the trade-off relationship between balancing the precision and the volume of the mechanism. This paper proposes a principle for a new balancing method for the IB Magnet. This method uses a like-pole pair of magnets as a magnetic spring, whose repulsive force should equal the attractive force of an unlike-pole pair. To verify the proposed principle, a prototype of the IB Magnet was designed using a magnetic spring and verified through experiments such that its reduction rate is comparable to those of conventional IB Magnets. Moreover, a robotic clamp was developed as an application example that contains the proposed IB Magnets as its internal mechanism.

AB  - Continuum manipulators can accomplish various tasks in confined spaces, benefiting from their compliant structures and improved dexterity. Confined and unstructured spaces may require both enhanced stiffness of a continuum manipulator for precision and payload, as well as compliance for safe interaction. Thus, studies have been consistently dedicated to design continuum or articulated manipulators with tunable stiffness to adapt to different operating conditions. This paper presents a continuum manipulator with independently tunable stiffness where the stiffness variation does not affect the movement of the manipulator's end-effector. Moreover, the proposed continuum manipulator is found to have analytical inverse kinematics. The design concept, analytical kinematics, system construction and experimental characterizations are presented. The results showed that the manipulator's stiffness can be increased up to 3.61 times of the minimal value, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed idea.

AB  - Snake-like robots for endoscopic surgery make it possible to reach deep-seated lesions. With the use of small flexible tendon-driven instruments, it is possible to perform bimanual micro-surgical tasks that are challenging for standard endoscopic surgeries. Existing devices, however, lack articulated wrists and rolling motion of the end-effector. This paper presents a new instrument design with a distal-roll gripper for snake-like robots. The developed 5 DoFs miniaturized instruments with a diameter of 3 mm enable the deployment into narrow endoluminal channels. Issues related to actuation coupling, tendon slack, and backlash are addressed. Experimental results show that the distal-roll gripper can rotate 106Â°, and the actuated joints can achieve good repeatability and accuracy with the proposed compensation control scheme.

AB  - Motion planning for vehicles under the influence of flow fields can benefit from the idea of streamline-based planning, which exploits ideas from fluid dynamics to achieve computational efficiency. Important to such planners is an efficient means of computing the travel distance and direction between two points in free space, but this is difficult to achieve in strong incompressible flows such as ocean currents. We propose two useful distance functions in analytical form that combine Euclidean distance with values of the stream function associated with a flow field, and with an estimation of the strength of the opposing flow between two points. Further, we propose steering heuristics that are useful for steering towards a sampled point. We evaluate these ideas by integrating them with RRT* and comparing the algorithm's performance with state-of-the-art methods in an artificial flow field and in actual ocean prediction data in the region of the dominant East Australian Current between Sydney and Brisbane. Results demonstrate the method's computational efficiency and ability to find high-quality paths outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and show promise for practical use with autonomous marine robots.

AB  - Coral species detection underwater is a challenging problem. There are many cases when even the experts (marine biologists) fail to recognize corals, hence limiting ground truth annotation for training a robust detection system. Identifying coral species is fundamental for enabling the monitoring of coral reefs, a task currently performed by humans, which can be automated with the use of underwater robots. By employing temporal cues using a tracker on a high confidence prediction by a convolutional neural network-based object detector, we augment the collected dataset for the retraining of the object detector. However, using trackers to extract examples also introduces hard or mislabelled samples, which is counterproductive and will deteriorate the performance of the detector. In this work, we show that employing a simple deep neural network to filter out hard or mislabelled samples can help regulate sample extraction. We empirically evaluate our approach in a coral object dataset, collected via an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and human divers, that shows the benefit of incorporating extracted examples obtained from tracking. This work also demonstrates how controlling sample generation by tracking using a simple deep neural network can further improve an object detector.

AB  - This paper presents an observer-integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, called Disturbance OB-server Network (DOB-Net), for robots operating in environments where disturbances are unknown and time-varying, and may frequently exceed robot control capabilities. The DOB-Net integrates a disturbance dynamics observer network and a controller network. Originated from conventional DOB mechanisms, the observer is built and enhanced via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), encoding estimation of past values and prediction of future values of unknown disturbances in RNN hidden state. Such encoding allows the controller generate optimal control signals to actively reject disturbances, under the constraints of robot control capabilities. The observer and the controller are jointly learned within policy optimization by advantage actor critic. Numerical simulations on position regulation tasks have demonstrated that the proposed DOB-Net significantly outperforms conventional feedback controllers and classical RL policy.

AB  - Ocean Worlds represent one of the best chances for extra-terrestrial life in our solar system. A new mission concept must be developed to explore these oceans. This mission would require traversing the 10s of km thick icy shell and releasing a submersible into the ocean below. During the transit of the icy shell and the exploration of the ocean, the vehicle(s) would be out of contact with Earth for weeks or potentially months at a time. During this time the vehicle must have sufficient autonomy to locate and study scientific targets of interest. One such target of interest is hydrothermal venting. We have previously developed an autonomous nested search method to locate and investigate sources of hydrothermal venting by locating local maxima in hydrothermal vent emissions. In this work we demonstrate this approach on board an OceanServer Iver2 AUV in Chesapeake Bay, MD using simulated sensor data from a hydrothermal plume model. This represents the first step towards the deployment of this approach in conditions analogous to those that we might expect on an Ocean World.

AB  - Photogrammetry techniques used for 3D reconstructions and motion estimation from images are based on projective geometry that models the image formation process. However, in the underwater setting, refraction of light rays at the housing interface introduce non-linear effects in the image formation. These effects produce systematic errors if not accounted for, and severely degrade the quality of the acquired images. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the calibration of cameras inside spherical domes with large offsets between dome and camera centers. Such large offsets not only amplify the effect of refraction, but also introduce blur in the image that corrupts feature extractors used to establish image-world correspondences in existing refractive calibration methods. We propose using the point spread function (PSF) as a complete description of the optical system and introduce a procedure to recover the camera pose inside the dome based on the measurement of the distortions. Results on a collected dataset show the method is capable of recovering the camera pose with high accuracy.

AB  - There is a long history demonstrating humans' tendency to create artificial copies of living creatures. For moving machines called robots, actuators play a key role in developing human-like movements. Among different types of actuation, PAMs (pneumatic artificial muscles) are known as the most similar ones to biological muscles. In addition to similarities in force generation mechanism (tension based), the well-accepted argumentation from Klute et al., states that the PAM force-length (fl) behavior is close to biological muscles, while the force-velocity (fv) pattern is different. Using the multiplicative formulation of the pressure (as an activation term), fl and fv beside an additive passive parallel elastic element, we present a new model of PAM. This muscle-based model can predict PAM dynamic behaviors with high precision. With a second experiment on a two-segmented leg, the proposed model is verified to predict the generated forces of PAMs in an antagonistic arrangement. Such a dynamic muscle-like model of artificial muscles can be used for the design and control of legged robots to generate robust, efficient and versatile gaits.

AB  - Light-weight robotic manipulators can be used to restore the manipulation capability of people with a motor disability. However, manipulating the environment poses a complex task, especially when the control interface is of low bandwidth, as may be the case for users with impairments. Therefore, we propose a constraint-based shared control scheme to define skills which provide support during task execution. This is achieved by representing a skill as a sequence of states, with specific user command mappings and different sets of constraints being applied in each state. New skills are defined by combining different types of constraints and conditions for state transitions, in a human-readable format. We demonstrate its versatility in a pilot experiment with three activities of daily living. Results show that even complex, high-dimensional tasks can be performed with a low-dimensional interface using our shared control approach.

AB  - Enabling robots to understand instructions provided via spoken natural language would facilitate interaction between robots and people in a variety of settings in homes and workplaces. However, natural language instructions are often missing information that would be obvious to a human based on environmental context and common sense, and hence does not need to be explicitly stated. In this paper, we introduce Language-Model-based Commonsense Reasoning (LMCR), a new method which enables a robot to listen to a natural language instruction from a human, observe the environment around it, and automatically fill in information missing from the instruction using environmental context and a new commonsense reasoning approach. Our approach first converts an instruction provided as unconstrained natural language into a form that a robot can understand by parsing it into verb frames. Our approach then fills in missing information in the instruction by observing objects in its vicinity and leveraging commonsense reasoning. To learn commonsense reasoning automatically, our approach distills knowledge from large unstructured textual corpora by training a language model. Our results show the feasibility of a robot learning commonsense knowledge automatically from web-based textual corpora, and the power of learned commonsense reasoning models in enabling a robot to autonomously perform tasks based on incomplete natural language instructions.

AB  - Defining a robot's expressivity is a difficult task that requires thoughtful consideration of the potential of various robot modalities and a model of communication that humans understand. Humanoid and zoomorphic-designed robots can easily take cues from human and animals, respectively when designing their expressivity. However, a robot design that is neither human nor animal-like does not have a clear model to follow in terms of designing expressivity. Animation presents a potential model in these circumstances as animated characters in movies take various forms, sizes, shapes and styles, and are successful in defining expressivity that is widely accepted across different languages and cultures. In this paper, we discuss the development and design of the expressivity of Haru, a table top robot that is neither human nor animal-like and the application of animation expertise to the holistic treatment of the different modalities. The method maximizes animation techniques and expertise normally applied to movies to generate expressivity that is then transferred to the robot hardware. Experimental results show that the robot's expressivity generated using our method is easily understood and are preferred to the conventional approach of generating expressions.

AB  - We aim for mobile robots to function in a variety of common human environments. Such robots need to be able to reason about the locations of previously unseen target objects. Landmark objects can help this reasoning by narrowing down the search space significantly. More specifically, we can exploit background knowledge about common spatial relations between landmark and target objects. For example, seeing a table and knowing that cups can often be found on tables aids the discovery of a cup. Such correlations can be expressed as distributions over possible pairing relationships of objects. In this paper, we propose an active visual object search strategy method through our introduction of the Semantic Linking Maps (SLiM) model. SLiM simultaneously maintains the belief over a target object's location as well as landmark objects' locations, while accounting for probabilistic inter-object spatial relations. Based on SLiM, we describe a hybrid search strategy that selects the next best view pose for searching for the target object based on the maintained belief. We demonstrate the efficiency of our SLiM-based search strategy through comparative experiments in simulated environments. We further demonstrate the realworld applicability of SLiM-based search in scenarios with a Fetch mobile manipulation robot.

AB  - Recovering the 3D structure of the surrounding environment is an essential task in any vision-controlled Structure-from-Motion (SfM) scheme. This paper focuses on the theoretical properties of the SfM, known as the incremental active depth estimation. The term incremental stands for estimating the 3D structure of the scene over a chronological sequence of image frames. Active means that the camera actuation is such that it improves estimation performance. Starting from a known depth estimation filter, this paper presents the stability analysis of the filter in terms of the control inputs of the camera. By analyzing the convergence of the estimator using the Lyapunov theory, we relax the constraints on the projection of the 3D point in the image plane when compared to previous results. Nonetheless, our method is capable of dealing with the cameras' limited field-of-view constraints. The main results are validated through experiments with simulated data.

AB  - Aerial imagery plays an important role in land-use planning, population analysis, precision agriculture, and unmanned aerial vehicle tasks. However, existing aerial image datasets generally suffer from the problem of inaccurate labeling, single ground truth type, and few category numbers. In this work, we implement a simulator that can simultaneously acquire diverse visual ground truth data in the virtual environment. Based on that, we collect a comprehensive Virtual AeriaL Image Dataset named VALID, consisting of 6690 high-resolution images, all annotated with panoptic segmentation on 30 categories, object detection with oriented bounding box, and binocular depth maps, collected in 6 different virtual scenes and 5 various ambient conditions (sunny, dusk, night, snow and fog). To our knowledge, VALID is the first aerial image dataset that can provide panoptic level segmentation and complete dense depth maps. We analyze the characteristics of VALID and evaluate state-of-the-art methods for multiple tasks to provide reference baselines. The experiment results demonstrate that VALID is well presented and challenging. The dataset is available at https://sites.google.com/view/valid-dataset/.

AB  - Loop closure detection is an essential and challenging problem in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). It is often tackled with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor due to its view-point and illumination invariant properties. Existing works on 3D loop closure detection often leverage on matching of local or global geometrical-only descriptors which discard intensity reading. In this paper we explore the intensity property from LiDAR scan and show that it can be effective for place recognition. We propose a novel global descriptor, intensity scan context (ISC), that explores both geometry and intensity characteristics. To improve the efficiency for loop closure detection, an efficient two-stage hierarchical re-identification process is proposed, including binary-operation based fast geometric relation retrieval and intensity structure re-identification. Thorough experiments including both local experiment and public datasets test have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Our method achieves better recall rate and recall precision than existing geometric-only methods.

AB  - We propose to integrate text objects in man-made scenes tightly into the visual SLAM pipeline. The key idea of our novel text-based visual SLAM is to treat each detected text as a planar feature which is rich of textures and semantic meanings. The text feature is compactly represented by three parameters and integrated into visual SLAM by adopting the illumination-invariant photometric error. We also describe important details involved in implementing a full pipeline of text-based visual SLAM. To our best knowledge, this is the first visual SLAM method tightly coupled with the text features. We tested our method in both indoor and outdoor environments. The results show that with text features, the visual SLAM system becomes more robust and produces much more accurate 3D text maps that could be useful for navigation and scene understanding in robotic or augmented reality applications.

AB  - Many approaches have been proposed to estimate camera poses by directly minimizing photometric error. However, due to the non-convex property of direct alignment, proper initialization is still required for these methods. Many robust norms (e.g. Huber norm) have been proposed to deal with the outlier terms caused by incorrect initializations. These robust norms are solely defined on the magnitude of each error term. In this paper, we propose a novel robust norm, named FlowNorm, that exploits the information from both the local error term and the global image registration information. While the local information is defined on patch alignments, the global information is estimated using a learning-based network. Using both the local and global information, we achieve a large convergence range in which images can be aligned given large view angle changes or small overlaps. We further demonstrate the usability of the proposed robust norm by integrating it into the direct methods DSO and BA-Net, and generate more robust and accurate results in real-time.

AB  - Adding more cameras to SLAM systems improves robustness and accuracy but complicates the design of the visual front-end significantly. Thus, most systems in the literature are tailored for specific camera configurations. In this work, we aim at an adaptive SLAM system that works for arbitrary multi-camera setups. To this end, we revisit several common building blocks in visual SLAM. In particular, we propose an adaptive initialization scheme, a sensor-agnostic, information- theoretic keyframe selection algorithm, and a scalable voxel- based map. These techniques make little assumption about the actual camera setups and prefer theoretically grounded methods over heuristics. We adapt a state-of-the-art visual- inertial odometry with these modifications, and experimental results show that the modified pipeline can adapt to a wide range of camera setups (e.g., 2 to 6 cameras in one experiment) without the need of sensor-specific modifications or tuning.

AB  - The static world assumption is standard in most simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Increased deployment of autonomous systems to unstructured dynamic environments is driving a need to identify moving objects and estimate their velocity in real-time. Most existing SLAM based approaches rely on a database of 3D models of objects or impose significant motion constraints. In this paper, we propose a new feature-based, model-free, object-aware dynamic SLAM algorithm that exploits semantic segmentation to allow estimation of motion of rigid objects in a scene without the need to estimate the object poses or have any prior knowledge of their 3D models. The algorithm generates a map of dynamic and static structure and has the ability to extract velocities of rigid moving objects in the scene. Its performance is demonstrated on simulated, synthetic and real-world datasets.

AB  - The question of "representation" is central in the context of dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Learning-based approaches have the potential to leverage data or task performance to directly inform the representation. However, blending representation learning approaches with "classical" SLAM systems has remained an open question, because of their highly modular and complex nature. A SLAM system transforms raw sensor inputs into a distribution over the state(s) of the robot and the environment. If this transformation (SLAM) were expressible as a differentiable function, we could leverage task-based error signals over the outputs of this function to learn representations that optimize task performance. However, this is infeasible as several components of a typical dense SLAM system are non-differentiable. In this work, we propose âSLAM (gradSLAM), a methodology for posing SLAM systems as differentiable computational graphs, which unifies gradient-based learning and SLAM. We propose differentiable trust-region optimizers, surface measurement and fusion schemes, and raycasting, without sacrificing accuracy. This amalgamation of dense SLAM with computational graphs enables us to backprop all the way from 3D maps to 2D pixels, opening up new possibilities in gradient-based learning for SLAM1.

AB  - When members of a multi-robot team follow regular motion rules sensitive to robots and other environmental factors within sensing range, the team itself may become an informational fabric for gaining situational awareness without explicit signalling among robots. In our previous work [1], we used machine learning to develop a scalable module, trained only on data from 3-robot teams, that could predict the positions of all robots in larger multi-robot teams based only on observations of the movement of a robot's nearest neighbor. Not only was this approach scalable from 3-to-many robots, but it did not require knowledge of the control laws of the robots under observation, as would a traditional observer-based approach. However, performance was only tested in simulation and could only be a substitute for explicit communication for short periods of time or in cases of very low sensing noise. In this work, we apply more sophisticated machine learning methods to data from a physically realized robotic team to develop Remote Teammate Localization (ReTLo) modules that can be used in realistic environments. To be specific, we adopt Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) [2] to learn the evolution of behaviors in a modular team, which has the effect of greatly reducing errors from regression outcomes. In contrast with our previous work in simulation, all of the experiments conducted in this work were conducted on the Thymio physical, two-wheeled robotic platform.

AB  - Learning-based ego-motion estimation approaches have recently drawn strong interest from researchers, mostly focusing on visual perception. A few learning-based approaches using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have been re-ported; however, they heavily rely on a supervised learning manner. Despite the meaningful performance of these approaches, supervised training requires ground-truth pose labels, which is the bottleneck for real-world applications. Differing from these approaches, we focus on unsupervised learning for LiDAR odometry (LO) without trainable labels. Achieving trainable LO in an unsupervised manner, we introduce the uncertainty-aware loss with geometric confidence, thereby al-lowing the reliability of the proposed pipeline. Evaluation on the KITTI, Complex Urban, and Oxford RobotCar datasets demonstrate the prominent performance of the proposed method compared to conventional model-based methods. The proposed method shows a comparable result against SuMa (in KITTI), LeGO-LOAM (in Complex Urban), and Stereo-VO (in Oxford RobotCar).

AB  - Learning from observation (LfO) offers a new paradigm for transferring task behavior to robots. LfO requires the robot to observe the task being performed and decompose the sensed streaming data into sequences of state-action pairs, which are then input to LfO methods. Thus, recognizing the state-action pairs correctly and quickly in sensed data is a crucial prerequisite. We present SA-Net a deep neural network architecture that recognizes state-action pairs from RGB-D data streams. SA-Net performs well in two replicated robotic applications of LfO - one involving mobile ground robots and another involving a robotic manipulator - which demonstrates that the architecture could generalize well to differing contexts. Comprehensive evaluations including deployment on a physical robot show that SA-Net significantly improves on the accuracy of the previous methods under various conditions.

AB  - Robots navigating in human crowds need to optimize their paths not only for their task performance but also for their compliance to social norms. One of the key challenges in this context is the lack of standard metrics for evaluating and optimizing a socially compliant behavior. Existing works in social navigation can be grouped according to the differences in their optimization objectives. For instance, the reinforcement learning approaches tend to optimize on the comfort aspect of the socially compliant navigation, whereas the inverse reinforcement learning approaches are designed to achieve natural behavior. In this paper, we propose NaviGAN, a generative navigation algorithm that jointly optimizes both of the comfort and naturalness aspects. Our approach is designed as an adversarial training framework that can learn to generate a navigation path that is both optimized for achieving a goal and for complying with latent social rules. A set of experiments has been carried out on multiple datasets to demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach quantitatively. We also perform extensive experiments using a physical robot in a realworld environment to qualitatively evaluate the trained social navigation behavior.

AB  - While robot learning has demonstrated promising results for enabling robots to automatically acquire new skills, a critical challenge in deploying learning-based systems is scale: acquiring enough data for the robot to effectively generalize broadly. Imitation learning, in particular, has remained a stable and powerful approach for robot learning, but critically relies on expert operators for data collection. In this work, we target this challenge, aiming to build an imitation learning system that can continuously improve through autonomous data collection, while simultaneously avoiding the explicit use of reinforcement learning, to maintain the stability, simplicity, and scalability of supervised imitation. To accomplish this, we cast the problem of imitation with autonomous improvement into a multi-task setting. We utilize the insight that, in a multi-task setting, a failed attempt at one task might represent a successful attempt at another task. This allows us to leverage the robot's own trials as demonstrations for tasks other than the one that the robot actually attempted. Using an initial dataset of multitask demonstration data, the robot autonomously collects trials which are only sparsely labeled with a binary indication of whether the trial accomplished any useful task or not. We then embed the trials into a learned latent space of tasks, trained using only the initial demonstration dataset, to draw similarities between various trials, enabling the robot to achieve one-shot generalization to new tasks. In contrast to prior imitation learning approaches, our method can autonomously collect data with sparse supervision for continuous improvement, and in contrast to reinforcement learning algorithms, our method can effectively improve from sparse, task-agnostic reward signals.

AB  - Learning meaningful visual representations in an embedding space can facilitate generalization in downstream tasks such as action segmentation and imitation. In this paper, we learn a motion-centric representation of surgical video demonstrations by grouping them into action segments/subgoals/options in a semi-supervised manner. We present Motion2Vec, an algorithm that learns a deep embedding feature space from video observations by minimizing a metric learning loss in a Siamese network: images from the same action segment are pulled together while pushed away from randomly sampled images of other segments, while respecting the temporal ordering of the images. The embeddings are iteratively segmented with a recurrent neural network for a given parametrization of the embedding space after pre-training the Siamese network. We only use a small set of labeled video segments to semantically align the embedding space and assign pseudo-labels to the remaining unlabeled data by inference on the learned model parameters. We demonstrate the use of this representation to imitate surgical suturing kinematic motions from publicly available videos of the JIGSAWS dataset. Results give 85.5% segmentation accuracy on average suggesting performance improvement over several state-of-the-art baselines, while kinematic pose imitation gives 0.94 centimeter error in position per observation on the test set.

AB  - This paper proposes a new path planning algorithm to consider motion uncertainty for wheeled robots in rough environments. The proposed method uses particles to express the uncertainty propagation in complicated environments constructed with various types of terrain. Also, RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) is expanded based on the uncertainty of each node in order to prevent increasing the accumulated position uncertainty. As a result, the generated path reduces the times of path-following and re-planning based on inaccurate localization information. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in simulation using motion uncertainty models obtained by experiments. The results show that the proposed method decreases the position uncertainty while keeping the probability to avoid collisions and to reach the goal area compared with conventional approaches.

AB  - RRT* is one of the most widely used sampling-based algorithms for asymptotically-optimal motion planning. RRT* laid the foundations for optimality in motion planning as a whole, and inspired the development of numerous new algorithms in the field, many of which build upon RRT* itself. In this paper, we first identify a logical gap in the optimality proof of RRT*, which was developed by Karaman and Frazzoli (2011). Then, we present an alternative and mathematically-rigorous proof for asymptotic optimality. Our proof suggests that the connection radius used by RRT* should be increased from Î³ (log n/n)1/d to Î³' (log n/n)1/(d+1) in order to account n n for the additional dimension of time that dictates the samples' ordering. Here Î³, Î³' are constants, and n, d are the number of samples and the dimension of the problem, respectively.

AB  - We study fundamental theoretical aspects of probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) in the finite time (non-asymptotic) regime. In particular, we investigate how completeness and optimality guarantees of the approach are influenced by the underlying deterministic sampling distribution X and connection radius r > 0. We develop the notion of (Î´, Îµ)-completeness of the parameters X, r, which indicates that for every motion-planning problem of clearance at least Î´ > 0, PRM using X, r returns a solution no longer than 1+Îµ times the shortest Î´-clear path. Leveraging the concept of e-nets, we characterize in terms of lower and upper bounds the number of samples needed to guarantee (Î´, Îµ)-completeness. This is in contrast with previous work which mostly considered the asymptotic regime in which the number of samples tends to infinity. In practice, we propose a sampling distribution inspired by e-nets that achieves nearly the same coverage as grids while using fewer samples.

AB  - The complexity of surgical operation can be released significantly if surgical robots can learn the manipulation skills by imitation from complex tasks demonstrations such as puncture, suturing, and knotting, etc.. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm based manipulation skill transferring technique for robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery by Teaching by Demonstration. It employed Gaussian mixture model and Gaussian mixture Regression based dynamic movement primitive to model the high-dimensional human-like manipulation skill after multiple demonstrations. Furthermore, this approach fascinates the learning and trial phase performed offline, which reduces the risks and cost for the practical surgical operation. Finally, it is demonstrated by transferring manipulation skills for reaching and puncture using a KUKA LWR4+ robot in a lab setup environment. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for modelling and learning of human manipulation skill.

It is a challenging problem due to mod-eling and integrating dynamical uncertainties into a safe planning framework, and finding a solution in a computationally tractable way. In this work, we first develop a probabilistic model for dynamical uncertainties. Then, we provide a framework to generate a path that maximizes safety for complex missions by incorporating the uncertainty model. We also devise a Monte Carlo method to obtain a safe path efficiently. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it to potential alternatives in several case studies.

AB  - Iterative linear-quadratic (ILQ) methods are widely used in the nonlinear optimal control community. Recent work has applied similar methodology in the setting of multi-player general-sum differential games. Here, ILQ methods are capable of finding local equilibria in interactive motion planning problems in real-time. As in most iterative procedures, however, this approach can be sensitive to initial conditions and hyperparameter choices, which can result in poor computational performance or even unsafe trajectories. In this paper, we focus our attention on a broad class of dynamical systems which are feedback linearizable, and exploit this structure to improve both algorithmic reliability and runtime. We showcase our new algorithm in three distinct traffic scenarios, and observe that in practice our method converges significantly more often and more quickly than was possible without exploiting the feedback linearizable structure.

AB  - Hybrid aerial-aquatic vehicles have the unique ability of travelling in both air and water and can benefit from both lower fluid resistance in air and energy efficient position holding in water. However, they have to address the differing requirements which make optimising a single design difficult. While existing examples have shown the possibility of such vehicles, they are mostly structurally identical to normal aerial vehicles with minor adjustments to work underwater. Instead of using rotational acceleration to direct a component of thrust in surge and sway, we propose a quadrotor based vehicle that tilts its rotors about the respective arm so that a larger component of thrust can be directed in the lateral plane or in the opposite direction without rotating the vehicle body. A small-scale prototype of this design is presented here, detailing the design considerations including mechanical actuation, static stability and waterproofing.

AB  - For most people on the ground, facing an unwanted drone buzzing around overhead, there is not a lot that we can do, especially if it is out of gun (radio wave gun or shotgun) range. A solution to this is to use intercept drones that seek out and bring down other drones. In order to make the interception autonomous, an image-based visual servo algorithm is designed with a forward-looking monocular camera. The control command, namely the angular velocity and thrust, is generated for intercept drones to implement accurate and fast interception. The proposed method is demonstrated in both hardware-in-the-loop simulation and demonstrative flight experiments.

AB  - A quadcopter is an under-actuated system with only four control inputs for six degrees of freedom, and yet the human control of a quadcopter is simple enough to be learned with some practice. In this work, we consider the problem of human control of a multiple quadcopters system to transport a cable-suspended payload. The coupled dynamics of the system, due to the inherent physical constraints, is used to develop a leader-follower architecture where the leader quadcopter is controlled directly by a human operator and the followers are controlled with the proposed Payload Attitude Controller and Cable Attitude Controller. Experiments, where a human operator flew a two quadcopters system to transport a cable-suspended payload, were conducted to study the performance of proposed controller. The results demonstrated successful implementation of human control in these systems. This work presents the possibility of enabling manual control for on-the-go maneuvering of the quadcopter-payload system which motivates aerial transportation in the unknown environments.

AB  - With the increasing global popularity of self-driving cars, there is an immediate need for challenging real-world datasets for benchmarking and training various computer vision tasks such as 3D object detection. Existing datasets either represent simple scenarios or provide only day-time data. In this paper, we introduce a new challenging A*3D dataset which consists of RGB images and LiDAR data with a significant diversity of scene, time, and weather. The dataset consists of high-density images (â 10 times more than the pioneering KITTI dataset), heavy occlusions, a large number of nighttime frames (â 3 times the nuScenes dataset), addressing the gaps in the existing datasets to push the boundaries of tasks in autonomous driving research to more challenging highly diverse environments. The dataset contains 39K frames, 7 classes, and 230K 3D object annotations. An extensive 3D object detection benchmark evaluation on the A*3D dataset for various attributes such as high density, day-time/night-time, gives interesting insights into the advantages and limitations of training and testing 3D object detection in real-world setting.

AB  - 3D vehicle detection based on point cloud is a challenging task in real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Despite significant progress has been made, we observe two aspects to be further improved. First, the semantic context information in LiDAR is seldom explored in previous works, which may help identify ambiguous vehicles. Second, the distribution of point cloud on vehicles varies continuously with increasing depths, which may not be well modeled by a single model. In this work, we propose a unified model SegVoxelNet to address the above two problems. A semantic context encoder is proposed to leverage the free-of-charge semantic segmentation masks in the bird's eye view. Suspicious regions could be highlighted while noisy regions are suppressed by this module. To better deal with vehicles at different depths, a novel depth-aware head is designed to explicitly model the distribution differences and each part of the depth-aware head is made to focus on its own target detection range. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives in both accuracy and efficiency with point cloud as input only.

AB  - Research on advanced driver assistance systems for reducing risks to vulnerable road users (VRUs) has recently gained popularity because the traffic accident reduction rate for VRUs is still small. Dealing with unexpected VRU movements on residential roads requires proficient acceleration and deceleration. Although fine-grained prediction of driving behavior through inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) has been reported with promising results in recent years, learning of a precise model fails when driving strategies vary with contextual factors, i.e., weather, time of day, road width, and traffic direction. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task IRL approach with a multilinear reward function to incorporate contextual information into the model. This approach can provide precise long-term prediction of fine-grained driving behavior while adjusting to context. Experimental results using actual driving data over 141 km with various contexts and roads confirm the success of this approach in terms of predicting defensive driving strategy even in unknown situations.

AB  - The current state of the art in automotive high definition digital (HD) map generation based on dedicated mapping vehicles cannot reliably keep these maps up to date because of the low traversal frequencies. Anonymized data collected from the fleet of vehicles that is already on the road provides a huge potential to outperform such state of the art solutions in robustness, safety and up-to-dateness of the map while achieving comparable quality. We thus present a solution based on crowdsourced data to (i) detect changes in the map independent of the type of change, (ii) automatically trigger map update jobs for parts of the map, and (iii) create and integrate map patches to keep the map always up to date. The developed solution provides a crowdsourced up to date HD map to make reliable prior information on lane markings and road edges available to automated driving functions.

AB  - Driveable area detection is a key component for various applications in the field of autonomous driving (AD), such as ground-plane detection, obstacle detection and maneuver planning. Additionally, bulky and over-parameterized networks can be easily forgone and replaced with smaller networks for faster inference on embedded systems. The driveable area detection, posed as a two class segmentation task, can be efficiently modeled with slim binary networks. This paper proposes a novel binarized driveable area detection network (binary DAD-Net), which uses only binary weights and activations in the encoder, the bottleneck, and the decoder part. The latent space of the bottleneck is efficiently increased (Ã32âÃ16 downsampling) through binary dilated convolutions, learning more complex features. Along with automatically generated training data, the binary DAD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on public datasets. In comparison to a full-precision model, our approach has a Ã14.3 reduced compute complexity on an FPGA and it requires only 0.9MB memory resources. Therefore, commodity SIMD-based AD-hardware is capable of accelerating the binary DAD-Net.

AB  - Mapping and localization is a critical module of autonomous driving, and significant achievements have been reached in this field. Beyond Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), research in point cloud registration, visual feature matching, and inertia navigation has greatly enhanced the accuracy and robustness of mapping and localization in different scenarios. However, highly urbanized scenes are still challenging: LIDAR- and camera-based methods perform poorly with numerous dynamic objects; the GNSS-based solutions experience signal loss and multi-path problems; the inertia measurement units (IMU) suffer from drifting. Unfortunately, current public datasets either do not adequately address this urban challenge or do not provide enough sensor information related to map-ping and localization. Here we present UrbanLoco: a mapping/localization dataset collected in highly-urbanized environments with a full sensor-suite. The dataset includes 13 trajectories collected in San Francisco and Hong Kong, covering a total length of over 40 kilometers. Our dataset includes a wide variety of urban terrains: urban canyons, bridges, tunnels, sharp turns, etc. More importantly, our dataset includes information from LIDAR, cameras, IMU, and GNSS receivers. Now the dataset is publicly available through the link in the footnote 1.

AB  - Accurate and robust global localization is essential to robotics applications. We propose a novel global localization method that employs the map traversability as a hidden observation. The resulting map-corrected odometry localization is able to provide an accurate belief tensor of the robot state. Our method can be used for blind robots in dark or highly reflective areas. In contrast to odometry drift in the long-term, our method using only odometry and the map converges in long-term. Our method can also be integrated with other sensors to boost the localization performance. The algorithm does not have any initial state assumption and tracks all possible robot states at all times. Therefore, our method is global and is robust in the event of ambiguous observations. We parallel each step of our algorithm such that it can be performed in real-time (up to ~300 Hz) using GPU. We validate our algorithm in different publicly available floor-plans and show that it is able to converge to the ground truth fast while being robust to ambiguities.

Our method defines a 2D pose for each human in a stereo pair of images and uses a correlation layer with a composite field to associate each left-right pair of joints. In absence of a stereo pose dataset, we show that we can train our method with synthetic data only and test it on real-world images (i.e., our training stage is domain invariant). Our method is particularly suitable for autonomous vehicles. We achieve state-of-the-art results for the 3D localization task on the challenging real-world KITTI dataset while running four times faster.

AB  - We present a self-supervised deep pose correction (DPC) network that applies pose corrections to a visual odometry estimator to improve its accuracy. Instead of regressing inter-frame pose changes directly, we build on prior work that uses data-driven learning to regress pose corrections that account for systematic errors due to violations of modelling assumptions. Our self-supervised formulation removes any requirement for six-degrees-of-freedom ground truth and, in contrast to expectations, often improves overall navigation accuracy compared to a supervised approach. Through extensive experiments, we show that our self-supervised DPC network can significantly enhance the performance of classical monocular and stereo odometry estimators and substantially out-performs state-of-the-art learning-only approaches.

AB  - Indoor positioning technology is essential for indoor mobile robots and drones. However, there has never been a general-purpose technology or infrastructure that enables indoor positioning with an accuracy of less than 10 cm. We have developed an attitude measurement method using multiple dynamic moires with a lenticular lens and developed an ultra- high-accuracy visual marker with an attitude estimation error of less than 0.1Â°. We also developed a calculation method that minimizes the marker position error by reminimizing reprojection error using its good attitude accuracy. We proved that accurate local positioning with a position error of about 1 cm in a marker coordinate system is possible even when a marker is shot from a distance of 10 m. In addition, a demonstration test was performed in a public space, and it was shown that high-accuracy global positioning with a position error of about 10 cm is possible.

AB  - Accurate localization and tracking are a fundamental requirement for robotic applications. Localization systems like GPS, optical tracking, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are used for daily life activities, research, and commercial applications. Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology provides another venue to accurately locate devices both indoors and outdoors. In this paper, we study a localization solution with a single UWB anchor, instead of the traditional multi-anchor setup. Besides the challenge of a single UWB ranging source, the only other sensor we require is a low-cost 9 DoF inertial measurement unit (IMU). Under such a configuration, we propose continuous monitoring of UWB range changes to estimate the robot speed when moving on a line. Combining speed estimation with orientation estimation from the IMU sensor, the system becomes temporally observable. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the pose of a robot. With our solution, we can effectively correct the accumulated error and maintain accurate tracking of a moving robot.

AB  - This paper presents a personalized gait optimization framework for lower-body exoskeletons. Rather than optimizing numerical objectives such as the mechanical cost of transport, our approach directly learns from user prefer-ences, e.g., for comfort. Building upon work in preference-based interactive learning, we present the CoSpar algorithm. CoSpar prompts the user to give pairwise preferences between trials and suggest improvements; as exoskeleton walking is a non-intuitive behavior, users can provide preferences more easily and reliably than numerical feedback. We show that CoSpar performs competitively in simulation and demonstrate a prototype implementation of CoSpar on a lower-body exoskeleton to optimize human walking trajectory features. In the experiments, CoSpar consistently found user-preferred parameters of the exoskeleton's walking gait, which suggests that it is a promising starting point for adapting and personalizing exoskeletons (or other assistive devices) to individual users.

AB  - Collaborative robots and space manipulators contain significant joint flexibility. It complicates the control design, compromises the control bandwidth, and limits the tracking accuracy. The imprecise knowledge of the flexible joint dynamics compounds the challenge. In this paper, we present a new control architecture for controlling flexible-joint robots. Our approach uses a multi-layer neural network to approximate unknown dynamics needed for the feedforward control. The network may be viewed as a linear-in-parameter representation of the robot dynamics, with the nonlinear basis of the robot dynamics connected to the linear output layer. The output layer weights are updated based on the tracking error and the nonlinear basis. The internal weights of the nonlinear basis are updated by online backpropagation to further reduce the tracking error. To use time scale separation to reduce the coupling of the two steps - the update of the internal weights is at a lower rate compared to the update of the output layer weights. With the update of the output layer weights, our controller adapts quickly to the unknown dynamics change and disturbances (such as attaching a load). The update of the internal weights would continue to improve the converge of the nonlinear basis functions. We show the stability of the proposed scheme under the "outer loop" control, where the commanded joint position is considered as the control input. Simulation and physical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller on a Baxter robot, which exhibits significant joint flexibility due to the series-elastic joint actuators.

AB  - Correlation filters (CFs) have shown excellent performance in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking scenarios due to their high computational efficiency. During the UAV tracking process, viewpoint variations are usually accompanied by changes in the object and background appearance, which poses a unique challenge to CF-based trackers. Since the appearance is gradually changing over time, an ideal tracker can not only forward predict the object position but also backtrack to locate its position in the previous frame. There exist response-based errors in the reversibility of the tracking process containing the information on the changes in appearance. However, some existing methods do not consider the forward and backward errors based on while using only the current training sample to learn the filter. For other ones, the applicants of considerable historical training samples impose a computational burden on the UAV. In this work, a novel bidirectional incongruity-aware correlation filter (BiCF) is proposed. By integrating the response-based bidirectional incongruity error into the CF, BiCF can Efficiently learn the changes in appearance and suppress the inconsistent error. Extensive experiments on 243 challenging sequences from three UAV datasets (UAV123, UAVDT, and DTB70) are conducted to demonstrate that BiCF favorably outperforms other 25 state-of-the-art trackers and achieves a real-time speed of 45.4 FPS on a single CPU, which can be applied in UAV Efficiently.

AB  - Studies on object rearrangement planning typically consider known objects. Some learning-based methods can predict the movement of an unknown object after single-step interaction, but require intermediate targets, which are generated manually, to achieve the rearrangement task. In this work, we propose a framework for unknown object rearrangement. Our system first models an object through a small-amount of identification actions and adjust the model parameters during task execution. We implement the proposed framework based on a low-cost tabletop robot (under 180 USD) to demonstrate the advantages of using a physics engine to assist action prediction. Experimental results reveal that after running our adaptive learning procedure, the robot can successfully arrange a novel object using an average of five discrete pushes on our tabletop environment and satisfy a precise 3.5 cm translation and 5Â° rotation criterion.

AB  - Performing Reinforcement Learning in sparse rewards settings, with very little prior knowledge, is a challenging problem since there is no signal to properly guide the learning process. In such situations, a good search strategy is fundamental. At the same time, not having to adapt the algorithm to every single problem is very desirable. Here we introduce TAXONS, a Task Agnostic eXploration of Outcome spaces through Novelty and Surprise algorithm. Based on a population-based divergent-search approach, it learns a set of diverse policies directly from high-dimensional observations, without any task-specific information. TAXONS builds a repertoire of policies while training an autoencoder on the high-dimensional observation of the final state of the system to build a low-dimensional outcome space. The learned outcome space, combined with the reconstruction error, is used to drive the search for new policies. Results show that TAXONS can find a diverse set of controllers, covering a good part of the ground-truth outcome space, while having no information about such space.

AB  - This paper presents a method to enable a robot using stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) to achieve high performance on a repetitive path-following task. In particular, we consider the case where the accuracy of the model for robot dynamics varies significantly over the path-motivated by the fact that the models used in MPC must be computationally efficient, which limits their expressive power. Our approach is based on correcting the cost predicted using a simple learned dynamics model over the MPC horizon. This discourages the controller from taking actions that lead to higher cost than would have been predicted using the dynamics model. In addition, stochastic MPC provides a quantitative measure of safety by limiting the probability of violating state and input constraints over the prediction horizon. Our approach is unique in that it combines both online model learning and cost learning over the prediction horizon and is geared towards operating a robot in changing conditions. We demonstrate our algorithm in simulation and experiment on a ground robot that uses a stereo camera for localization.

AB  - Current clinical endovascular interventions rely on 2D guidance for catheter manipulation. Although an aortic 3D surface is available from the pre-operative CT/MRI imaging, it cannot be used directly as a 3D intra-operative guidance since the vessel will deform during the procedure. This paper aims to reconstruct the live 3D aortic deformation by fusing the static 3D model from the pre-operative data and the 2D live imaging from fluoroscopy. In contrast to some existing deformation reconstruction frameworks which require 3D observations such as RGB-D or stereo images, fluoroscopy only presents 2D information. In the proposed framework, a 2D-3D registration is performed and the reconstruction process is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem based on the deformation graph approach. Detailed simulations and phantom experiments are conducted and the result demonstrates the reconstruction accuracy and robustness, as well as the potential clinical value of this framework.

AB  - Needle-based procedures, such as biopsy and percutaneous tumor ablation, highly depend on the accuracy of needle placement. The accuracy is significantly affected by the needle-tissue interaction no matter what needles (straight or steerable) are used. Due to the unknown tissue mechanics, it is challenging to achieve high accuracy in practice. This paper hence proposes a needle design with an articulated tip for increased steerability and improved needle path consistency. Due to the passive needle tip articulation, tissue mechanics always plays a dominant role such that the needle creates similar paths with approximately piece-wise constant curvature in different tissues. Kinematics model for the proposed needle is presented. The algorithms of path planning and needle tip pose estimation under external imaging modality are developed. Experimental verifications were conducted to demonstrate the needle's steerability as well as the target-reaching capability with obstacles avoidance.

AB  - This paper introduces a method for robotic steering of a flexible needle inside moving and deformable tissues. The method relies on a set of objective functions allowing to automatically steer the needle along a predefined path. In order to follow the desired trajectory, an inverse problem linking the motion of the robot end effector with the objective functions is solved using a Finite Element simulation. The main contribution of the article is the new constraint-based formulation of the objective functions allowing to: 1) significantly reduce the computation time; 2) increase the accuracy and stability of the simulation-guided needle insertion. The method is illustrated, and its performances are characterized in a realistic framework, using a direct simulation of the respiratory motion generated from in vivo data of a pig. Despite the highly non-linear behavior of the numerical simulation and the significant deformations occurring during the insertion, the obtained performances enable the possibility to follow the trajectory with the desired accuracy for medical purpose.

AB  - Master-slave systems for endovascular catheterization have brought major clinical benefits including reduced radiation doses to the operators, improved precision and stability of the instruments, as well as reduced procedural duration. Emerging deep reinforcement learning (RL) technologies could potentially automate more complex endovascular tasks with enhanced success rates, more consistent motion and reduced fatigue and cognitive workload of the operators. However, the complexity of the pulsatile flows within the vasculature and non-linear behavior of the instruments hinder the use of model-based approaches for RL. This paper describes model-free generative adversarial imitation learning to automate a standard arterial catherization task. The automation policies have been trained in a pre-clinical setting. Detailed validation results show high success rates after skill transfer to a different vascular anatomical model. The quality of the catheter motions also shows less mean and maximum contact forces compared to manual-based approaches.

AB  - Path planning algorithms for steerable catheters, must guarantee anatomical obstacles avoidance, reduce the insertion length and ensure the compliance with needle kinematics. The majority of the solutions in literature focuses on graph based or sampling based methods, both limited by the impossibility to directly obtain smooth trajectories. In this work we formulate the path planning problem as a reinforcement learning problem and show that the trajectory planning model, generated from the training, can provide the user with optimal trajectories in terms of obstacle clearance and kinematic constraints. We obtain 2D and 3D environments from MRI images processing and we implement a GA3C algorithm to create a path planning model, able to generalize on different patients anatomies. The curvilinear trajectories obtained from the model in 2D and 3D environments are compared to the ones obtained by A* and RRT* algorithms. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances in terms of obstacle avoidance, trajectory smoothness and computational time proving this algorithm as valid planning method for complex environments.

AB  - We present a novel control strategy for dynamic legged locomotion in complex scenarios that considers information about the morphology of the terrain in contexts when only on-board mapping and computation are available. The strategy is built on top of two main elements: first a contact sequence task that provides safe foothold locations based on a convolutional neural network to perform fast and continuous evaluation of the terrain in search of safe foothold locations; then a model predictive controller that considers the foothold locations given by the contact sequence task to optimize target ground reaction forces. We assess the performance of our strategy through simulations of the hydraulically actuated quadruped robot HyQReal traversing rough terrain under realistic on-board sensing and computing conditions.

AB  - This paper presents an adaptive control scheme for robotic systems that operate in the face of-potentially large-structured uncertainty. The proposed adaptive controller employs an on-line supervisor that utilizes logic-based switching among a finite set of controllers to identify uncertain parameters, and adapt the behavior of the system based on a current estimate of their value. To achieve this, the adaptive control approach in this paper combines on-line parameter estimation and feedback control while avoiding some of the inherent difficulties of classical adaptive control strategies. Furthermore, the proposed supervisory control architecture is modular as it relies on established "off-the-shelf" feedback control law and estimator design approaches, instead of cus-tomizing the overall design to the specific requirements of an adaptive control algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on the problem of a dynamically-walking bipedal robot delivering a payload of unknown mass, and show that, by switching to the controller that is the "best" according to a current estimate of the uncertainty, the system maintains a low energy cost during its operation.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel algorithm for joint space position/torque hybrid control of a mammal-type quadruped robot. With this control algorithm, the robot demonstrated both dynamic locomotion and push reaction abilities without the need for torque control in the ab/ad joints. Based on the tipping and slipping condition of the legged robot, we showed that reaction to a typical push in the horizontal direction does not require full contact-force-control in the frontal plane. Furthermore, we showed that position/torque hybrid control in Cartesian space is directly applicable to joint space hybrid control due to the joint configuration of the quadruped robot. We conducted experiments on our legged robot platform to verify the performance of our hybrid control algorithm. With this approach, the robot displayed stability while walking and reacting to external push disturbances.

AB  - Robotic Hopping is challenging from the perspective of both modeling the dynamics as well as the mechanical design due to the short period of ground contact in which to actuate on the world. Previous work has demonstrated stable hopping on a moving-mass robot, wherein a single spring was utilized below the body of the robot. This paper finds that the addition of a spring in parallel to the actuator greatly improves the performance of moving mass hopping robots. This is demonstrated through the design of a novel one-dimensional hopping robot. For this robot, a rigorous trajectory optimization method is developed using hybrid systems models with experimentally tuned parameters. Simulation results are used to study the effects of a parallel spring on energetic efficiency, stability, and hopping effort. We find that the double-spring model had 2.5x better energy efficiency than the single-spring model, and was able to hop using 40% less peak force from the actuator. Furthermore, the double-spring model produces stable hopping without the need for stabilizing controllers. These concepts are demonstrated experimentally on a novel hopping robot, wherein hop heights up to 40cm were achieved with comparable efficiency and stability.

AB  - Legged robots have been highlighted as promising mobile platforms for disaster response and rescue scenarios because of their rough terrain locomotion capability. In cluttered environments, small robots are desirable as they can maneuver through small gaps, narrow paths, or tunnels. However small robots have their own set of difficulties such as limited space for sensors, limited obstacle clearance, and scaled-down walking speed. In this paper, we extensively address these difficulties via effective sensor integration and exploitation of dynamic locomotion and jumping. We integrate two Intel RealSense sensors into the MIT Mini-Cheetah, a 0.3 m tall, 9 kg quadruped robot. Simple and effective filtering and evaluation algorithms are used for foothold adjustment and obstacle avoidance. We showcase the exploration of highly irregular terrain using dynamic trotting and jumping with the small-scale, fully sensorized Mini-Cheetah quadruped robot.

AB  - We aim to guard swarm-robotics applications against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that result in withdrawals of robots. We focus on applications requiring the selection of actions for each robot, among a set of available ones, e.g., which trajectory to follow. Such applications are central in large-scale robotic applications, e.g., multi-robot motion planning for target tracking. But the current attack-robust algorithms are centralized, and scale quadratically with the problem size (e.g., number of robots). In this paper, we propose a general-purpose distributed algorithm towards robust optimization at scale, with local communications only. We name it distributed robust maximization (DRM). DRM proposes a divide-and-conquer approach that distributively partitions the problem among K cliques of robots. The cliques optimize in parallel, independently of each other. That way, DRM also offers computational speed-ups up to 1/K2 the running time of its centralized counterparts. K depends on the robots' communication range, which is given as input to DRM. DRM also achieves a close-to-optimal performance. We demonstrate DRM's performance in Gazebo and MATLAB simulations, in scenarios of active target tracking with multiple robots. We observe DRM achieves significant computational speed-ups (it is 3 to 4 orders faster) and, yet, nearly matches the tracking performance of its centralized counterparts.

AB  - We study a patrolling problem where multiple agents are tasked with protecting an environment where one or more adversaries are trying to compromise targets of varying value. The objective of the patrollers is to move between targets to quickly spot when an attack is taking place and then diffuse it. Differently from most related literature, we do not assume that attackers have full knowledge of the strategies followed by the patrollers, but rather build a model at run time through repeated observations of how often they visit certain targets. We study three different solutions to this problem. The first two partition the environment using either a fast heuristic or an exact method that is significantly more time consuming. The third method, instead does not partition the environment, but rather lets every patroller roam over the entire environment. After having identified strengths and weaknesses of each method, we contrast their performances against attackers using different algorithms to decide whether to attack or not.

AB  - This paper presents a distributed optimization framework and its local utility design for communication-aware information gathering by mobile robotic sensor networks. The main idea of the optimization is that each robot decides based on its local utility that considers the decisions of other neighbor robots higher in a given hierarchy. The local utility is designed as conditional mutual information that captures sensing and communication properties. Sampling procedures using a specific measurement set and particle methods are applied to compute the designed utility, which allows nonlinear, non-Gaussian properties of targets, sensing, and communication. Simulation results describe the presented distributed optimization shows more improved estimates and entropy reduction than another approach that does not consider communication properties. Simulation results also verify the presented distributed optimization using the described approach for information computation has better results than using other approaches that simplify the communication-aware information.

AB  - We investigate algorithmic approaches for targeted drug delivery in a complex, maze-like environment, such as a vascular system. The basic scenario is given by a large swarm of micro-scale particles ("agents") and a particular target region ("tumor") within a system of passageways. Agents are too small to contain on-board power or computation and are instead controlled by a global external force that acts uniformly on all particles, such as an applied fluidic flow or electromagnetic field. The challenge is to deliver all agents to the target region with a minimum number of actuation steps. We provide a number of results for this challenge. We show that the underlying problem is NP-hard, which explains why previous work did not provide provably efficient algorithms. We also develop a number of algorithmic approaches that greatly improve the worst-case guarantees for the number of required actuation steps. We evaluate our algorithmic approaches by a number of simulations, both for deterministic algorithms and searches supported by deep learning, which show that the performance is practically promising.

AB  - Time-optimal trajectories for dynamic robotic vehicles are difficult to compute even for state-of-the-art nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers, due to nonlinearity and bang-bang control structure. This paper presents a bilevel optimization framework that addresses these problems by decomposing the spatial and temporal variables into a hierarchical optimization. Specifically, the original problem is divided into an inner layer, which computes a time-optimal velocity profile along a given geometric path, and an outer layer, which refines the geometric path by a Quasi-Newton method. The inner optimization is convex and efficiently solved by interior-point methods. The gradients of the outer layer can be analytically obtained using sensitivity analysis of parametric optimization problems. A novel contribution is to introduce a duality gap in the inner optimization rather than solving it to optimality; this lets the optimizer realize warm-starting of the interior-point method, avoids non-smoothness of the outer cost function caused by active inequality constraint switching. Like prior bilevel frameworks, this method is guaranteed to return a feasible solution at any time, but converges faster than gap-free bilevel optimization. Numerical experiments on a drone model with velocity and acceleration limits show that the proposed method performs faster and more robustly than gap-free bilevel optimization and general NLP solvers.

AB  - We propose a sampling-based trajectory optimization methodology for constrained problems. We extend recent works on stochastic search to deal with box control constraints, as well as nonlinear state constraints for discrete dynamical systems. Regarding the former, our strategy is to optimize over truncated parameterized distributions on control inputs. Furthermore, we show how non-smooth penalty functions can be incorporated into our framework to handle state constraints. Simulations on cartpole and quadcopter show that our approach outperforms previous methods on constrained sampling-based optimization, in terms of quality of solutions and convergence speed.

AB  - The ability to optimally control robotic systems offers significant advantages for their performance. While time-dependent optimal trajectories can numerically be computed for high dimensional nonlinear system dynamic models, constraints and objectives, finding optimal feedback control policies for such systems is hard. This is unfortunate, as without a policy, the control of real-world systems requires frequent correction or replanning to compensate for disturbances and model errors.In this paper, a feedback control policy is learned from a set of optimal reference trajectories using Gaussian processes. Information from existing trajectories and the current policy is used to find promising start points for the computation of further optimal trajectories. This aspect is important as it avoids exhaustive sampling of the complete state space, which is impractical due to the high dimensional state space, and to focus on the relevant region.The presented method has been applied in simulation to a swing-up problem of an underactuated pendulum and an energy-minimal point-to-point movement of a 3-DOF industrial robot.

AB  - We introduce Crocoddyl (Contact RObot COntrol by Differential DYnamic Library), an open-source framework tailored for efficient multi-contact optimal control. Crocoddyl efficiently computes the state trajectory and the control policy for a given predefined sequence of contacts. Its efficiency is due to the use of sparse analytical derivatives, exploitation of the problem structure, and data sharing. It employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. floating-base systems. Additionally, we propose a novel optimal control algorithm called Feasibility-driven Differential Dynamic Programming (FDDP). Our method does not add extra decision variables which often increases the computation time per iteration due to factorization. FDDP shows a greater globalization strategy compared to classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms. Concretely, we propose two modifications to the classical DDP algorithm. First, the backward pass accepts infeasible state-control trajectories. Second, the rollout keeps the gaps open during the early "exploratory" iterations (as expected in multipleshooting methods with only equality constraints). We showcase the performance of our framework using different tasks. With our method, we can compute highly-dynamic maneuvers (e.g. jumping, front-flip) within few milliseconds.

AB  - Integrated robotic arm system should contain both grasp and place actions. However, most grasping methods focus more on how to grasp objects, while ignoring the placement of the grasped objects, which limits their applications in various industrial environments. In this research, we propose a model-free deep Q-learning method to learn the grasping-stacking strategy end-to-end from scratch. Our method maps the images to the actions of the robotic arm through two deep networks: the grasping network (GNet) using the observation of the desk and the pile to infer the gripper's position and orientation for grasping, and the stacking network (SNet) using the observation of the platform to infer the optimal location when placing the grasped object. To make a long-range planning, the two observations are integrated in the grasping for stacking network (GSN). We evaluate the proposed GSN on a grasping-stacking task in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

AB  - Semantic grasping is the problem of selecting stable grasps that are functionally suitable for specific object manipulation tasks. In order for robots to effectively perform object manipulation, a broad sense of contexts, including object and task constraints, needs to be accounted for. We introduce the Context-Aware Grasping Engine, which combines a novel semantic representation of grasp contexts with a neural network structure based on the Wide & Deep model, capable of capturing complex reasoning patterns. We quantitatively validate our approach against three prior methods on a novel dataset consisting of 14,000 semantic grasps for 44 objects, 7 tasks, and 6 different object states. Our approach outperformed all baselines by statistically significant margins, producing new insights into the importance of balancing memorization and generalization of contexts for semantic grasping. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on robot experiments in which the presented model successfully achieved 31 of 32 suitable grasps.

AB  - Depth acquisition, based on active illumination, is essential for autonomous and robotic navigation. LiDARs (Light Detection And Ranging) with mechanical, fixed, sampling templates are commonly used in today's autonomous vehicles. An emerging technology, based on solid-state depth sensors, with no mechanical parts, allows fast and adaptive scans. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, image-driven, fast, sampling and reconstruction strategy. First, we formulate a piece-wise planar depth model and estimate its validity for indoor and outdoor scenes. Our model and experiments predict that, in the optimal case, adaptive sampling strategies with about 20-60 piece-wise planar structures can approximate well a depth map. This translates to requiring a single depth sample for every 1200 RGB samples (less than 0.1%), providing strong motivation to investigate an adaptive framework. Second, we introduce SPS (Super-Pixel Sampler), a simple, generic, sampling and reconstruction algorithm, based on super-pixels. Our sampling improves grid and random sampling, consistently, for a wide variety of reconstruction methods. Third, we propose an extremely simple and fast reconstruction for our sampler. It achieves state-of-the-art results, compared to complex image- guided depth completion algorithms, reducing the required sampling rate by a factor of 3-4. A single-pixel prototype sampler built in our lab illustrates the concept.

AB  - Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors play an important role in the perception stack of autonomous robots, supplying mapping and localization pipelines with depth measurements of the environment. While their accuracy outperforms other types of depth sensors, such as stereo or time-of-flight cameras, the accurate modeling of LIDAR sensors requires laborious manual calibration that typically does not take into account the interaction of laser light with different surface types, incidence angles and other phenomena that significantly influence measurements. In this work, we introduce a physically plausible model of a 2D continuous-wave LIDAR that accounts for the surface-light interactions and simulates the measurement process in the Hokuyo URG-04LX LIDAR. Through automatic differentiation, we employ gradient-based optimization to estimate model parameters from real sensor measurements.

AB  - Three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamic objects is important for robotic applications, for example, the robotic recognition and manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel 3D surface reconstruction method for moving objects. The proposed method combines the spatial-multiplexing and time-multiplexing structured-light techniques that have advantages of less image acquisition time and accurate 3D reconstruction, respectively. A set of spatial-temporal encoded patterns are designed, where a spatial-encoded texture map is embedded into the temporal-encoded three-step phase-shifting fringes. The specifically designed spatial-coded texture assigns high-uniqueness codeword to any window on the image which helps to eliminate the phase ambiguity. In addition, the texture is robust to noise and image blur. Combining this texture with high-frequency phase-shifting fringes, high reconstruction accuracy would be ensured. This method only requires 3 patterns to uniquely encode a surface, which facilitates the fast image acquisition for each reconstruction step. A filtering stereo matching algorithm is proposed for the spatial-temporal multiplexing method to improve the matching reliability. Moreover, the reconstruction precision is further enhanced by a correspondence refinement algorithm. Experiments validate the performance of the proposed method including the high accuracy, the robustness to noise and the ability to reconstruct moving objects.

AB  - Recent studies in radar-based navigation present promising navigation performance using scanning radars. These scanning radar-based odometry methods are mostly feature-based; they detect and match salient features within a radar image. Differing from existing feature-based methods, this paper reports on a method using direct radar odometry, PhaRaO, which infers relative motion from a pair of radar scans via phase correlation. Specifically, we apply the Fourier Mellin transform (FMT) for Cartesian and log-polar radar images to sequentially estimate rotation and translation. In doing so, we decouple rotation and translation estimations in a coarse-to-fine manner to achieve real-time performance. The proposed method is evaluated using large-scale radar data obtained from various environments. The inferred trajectory yields a 2.34% (translation) and 2.93Â° (rotation) Relative Error (RE) over a 4km path length on average for the odometry estimation.

AB  - Understanding the semantic characteristics of the environment is a key enabler for autonomous robot operation. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation of a LiDAR scan into the classes car, pedestrian and bicyclist. This architecture is based on dense blocks and efficiently utilizes depth separable convolutions to limit the number of parameters while still maintaining the state-of-the-art performance. To make the predictions from the DCNN temporally consistent, we propose a Bayes filter based method. This method uses the predictions from the neural network to recursively estimate the current semantic state of a point in a scan. This recursive estimation uses the knowledge gained from previous scans, thereby making the predictions temporally consistent and robust towards isolated erroneous predictions. We compare the performance of our proposed architecture with other state-of-the-art neural network architectures and report substantial improvement. For the proposed Bayes filter approach, we shows results on various sequences in the KITTI tracking benchmark.

AB  - Dual-arm robots can overcome grasping force and payload limitations of a single arm by jointly grasping an object. However, if the distribution of mass of the grasped object is not even, each arm will experience different wrenches that can exceed its payload limits. In this work, we consider the problem of balancing the wrenches experienced by a dual-arm robot grasping a rigid tray. The distribution of wrenches among the robot arms changes due to objects being placed on the tray. We present an approach to reduce the wrench imbalance among arms through discrete bimanual manipulation. Our approach is based on sequential sliding motions of the grasp points on the surface of the object, to attain a more balanced configuration. We validate our modeling approach and system design through a set of robot experiments.

AB  - Developing artificial tactile sensing capabilities that rival human touch is a long-term goal in robotics and prosthetics. Gradually more elaborate biomimetic tactile sensors are being developed and applied to grasping and manipulation tasks to help achieve this goal. Here we present the neuroTac, a novel neuromorphic optical tactile sensor. The neuroTac combines the biomimetic hardware design from the TacTip sensor which mimicks the layered papillae structure of human glabrous skin, with an event-based camera (DAVIS240, iniVation) and algorithms which transduce contact information in the form of spike trains. The performance of the sensor is evaluated on a texture classification task, with four spike coding methods being implemented and compared: Intensive, Spatial, Temporal and Spatiotemporal. We found timing-based coding methods performed with the highest accuracy over both artificial and natural textures. The spike-based output of the neuroTac could enable the development of biomimetic tactile perception algorithms in robotics as well as non-invasive and invasive haptic feedback methods in prosthetics.

AB  - How to reduce uncertainty in object pose estimation under complex contacts is crucial to autonomous robotic manipulation and assembly. In this paper, we introduce an approach through forecasting contact force from simulated complex contacts with calibration based on real force sensing. A constraint-based haptic simulation algorithm is used with sphere-tree representation of contacting objects to compute contact poses and forces, and through matching the computed forces to measured real force data via a regression model, the least-uncertain estimate of the relative contact pose is obtained. Our approach can handle multi-region complex contacts and does not make any assumption about contact types or contact locations. It also does not have restriction on object shapes. We have applied the force forecast approach to reducing uncertainty in estimating object poses in challenging peg-in-hole robotic assembly tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by successful completion of contact-rich two-pin and three-pin real peg-in-hole assembly tasks with complex shapes of pins and holes.

AB  - Fingernail imaging has been proven to be effective in prior works [1], [2] for estimating the 3D fingertip forces with a maximum RMS estimation error of 7%. In the current research, fingernail imaging is used to perform unconstrained grasp force measurement on multiple fingers to study human grasping. Moreover, two robotic arms with mounted cameras and a visual tracking system have been devised to keep the human fingers in the camera frame during the experiments. Experimental tests have been conducted for six human subjects under both constrained and unconstrained grasping conditions, and the results indicate a significant difference in force collaboration among the fingers between the two grasping conditions. Another interesting result according to the experiments is that in comparison to constrained grasping, unconstrained grasp forces are more evenly distributed over the fingers and there is less force variation (more steadiness) in each finger force. These results validate the importance of measuring grasp forces in an unconstrained manner in order to study how humans naturally grasp objects.

AB  - Given a set of 3D-to-2D point correspondences corrupted by outliers, we aim to robustly estimate the absolute camera pose. Existing methods robust to outliers either fail to guarantee high robustness and efficiency simultaneously, or require an appropriate initial pose and thus lack generality. In contrast, we propose a novel approach based on the robust "L2-minimizing estimate" (L2E) loss. We first define a novel cost function by integrating the projection constraint into the L2E loss. Then to efficiently obtain the global minimum of this function, we propose a hybrid strategy of a local optimizer and branch-and-bound. For branch-and-bound, we derive effective function bounds. Our approach can handle high outlier ratios, leading to high robustness. It can run reliably regardless of whether the initial pose is appropriate, providing high generality. Moreover, given a decent initial pose, it is suitable for real-time applications. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets showed that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and/or efficiency.

AB  - In this paper, we present an on-board vision-based approach for avoidance of moving obstacles in dynamic environments. Our approach relies on an efficient obstacle detection and tracking algorithm based on depth image pairs, which provides the estimated position, velocity and size of the obstacles. Robust collision avoidance is achieved by formulating a chance-constrained model predictive controller (CC-MPC) to ensure that the collision probability between the micro aerial vehicle (MAV) and each moving obstacle is below a specified threshold. The method takes into account MAV dynamics, state estimation and obstacle sensing uncertainties. The proposed approach is implemented on a quadrotor equipped with a stereo camera and is tested in a variety of environments, showing effective on-line collision avoidance of moving obstacles.

AB  - This paper presents a monocular vision based proximity estimation system using abstract features, such as corner points, blobs and edges, as inputs to a neural network. An experimental vehicle was built using a vision system integrating the SCAMP-5 vision chip, a micro-controller, and an RC model car. The vision chip includes image sensor with embedded 256Ã256 processor SIMD array. The pixel processor array chip was programmed to capture images and run the feature algorithms directly on the focal plane, and then digest them so that only sparse feature description data were read-out in the form of 40 values. By logging the vision output and the output from three infrared proximity sensors, training data were obtained to train three fully connected layer-recurrent neural networks with fewer than 700 parameters each. The trained neural network was able to estimate the proximity to the level of accuracy sufficient for a reactive collision avoidance behaviour to be achieved. The latency of the control system, from image capture to neural network output, was under 4ms, enabling the vehicles to avoid obstacles while moving at 0.64m/s to 1.8m/s in the experiment.

AB  - The motion of planar ground vehicles is often non-holonomic, and as a result may be modelled by the 2 DoF Ackermann steering model. We analyse the feasibility of estimating such motion with a downward facing camera that exerts fronto-parallel motion with respect to the ground plane. This turns the motion estimation into a simple image registration problem in which we only have to identify a 2-parameter planar homography. However, one difficulty that arises from this setup is that ground-plane features are indistinctive and thus hard to match between successive views. We encountered this difficulty by introducing the first globally-optimal, correspondence-less solution to plane-based Ackermann motion estimation. The solution relies on the branch-and-bound optimisation technique. Through the low-dimensional parametrisation, a derivation of tight bounds, and an efficient implementation, we demonstrate how this technique is eventually amenable to accurate real-time motion estimation. We prove its property of global optimality and analyse the impact of assuming a locally constant centre of rotation. Our results on real data finally demonstrate a significant advantage over the more traditional, correspondence-based hypothesise-and-test schemes.

AB  - The TEB hierarchical planner for real-time navigation through unknown environments is highly effective at balancing collision avoidance with goal directed motion. Designed over several years and publications, it implements a multi-trajectory optimization based synthesis method for identifying topologically distinct trajectory candidates through navigable space. Unfortunately, the underlying factor graph approach to the optimization problem induces a mismatch between grid-based representations and the optimization graph, which leads to several time and optimization inefficiencies. This paper explores the impact of using egocentric, perception space representations for the local planning map. Doing so alleviates many of the identified issues related to TEB and leads to a new method called egoTEB. Timing experiments and Monte Carlo evaluations in benchmark worlds quantify the benefits of egoTEB for navigation through uncertain environments.

AB  - Collecting and automatically obtaining reward signals from real robotic visual data for the purposes of training reinforcement learning algorithms can be quite challenging and time-consuming. Methods for utilizing unlabeled data can have a huge potential to further accelerate robotic learning. We consider here the problem of performing manipulation tasks from pixels. In such tasks, choosing an appropriate state representation is crucial for planning and control. This is even more relevant with real images where noise, occlusions and resolution affect the accuracy and reliability of state estimation. In this work, we learn a latent state representation implicitly with deep reinforcement learning in simulation, and then adapt it to the real domain using unlabeled real robot data. We propose to do so by optimizing sequence-based self- supervised objectives. These use the temporal nature of robot experience, and can be common in both the simulated and real domains, without assuming any alignment of underlying states in simulated and unlabeled real images. We further propose a novel such objective, the Contrastive Forward Dynamics loss, which combines dynamics model learning with time-contrastive techniques. The learned state representation that results from our methods can be used to robustly solve a manipulation task in simulation and to successfully transfer the learned skill on a real system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches by training a vision-based reinforcement learning agent for cube stacking. Agents trained with our method, using only 5 hours of unlabeled real robot data for adaptation, shows a clear improvement over domain randomization, and standard visual domain adaptation techniques for sim-to-real transfer.

AB  - Modern reinforcement learning methods suffer from low sample efficiency and unsafe exploration, making it infeasible to train robotic policies entirely on real hardware. In this work, we propose to address the problem of sim-to-real domain transfer by using meta learning to train a policy that can adapt to a variety of dynamic conditions, and using a task-specific trajectory generation model to provide an action space that facilitates quick exploration. We evaluate the method by performing domain adaptation in simulation and analyzing the structure of the latent space during adaptation. We then deploy this policy on a KUKA LBR 4+ robot and evaluate its performance on a task of hitting a hockey puck to a target. Our method shows more consistent and stable domain adaptation than the baseline, resulting in better overall performance.

AB  - General-purpose simulators can be a valuable data source for flexible learning and control approaches. However, training models or control policies in simulation and then directly applying to hardware can yield brittle control. Instead, we propose a novel way to use simulators as regularizers. Our approach regularizes a decoder of a variational autoencoder to a black-box simulation, with the latent space bound to a subset of simulator parameters. This enables successful encoder training from a small number of real-world trajectories (10 in our experiments), yielding a latent space with simulation parameter distribution that matches the real-world setting. We use a learnable mixture for the latent prior/posterior, which implies a highly flexible class of densities for the posterior fit. Our approach is scalable and does not require restrictive distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ability to recover matching parameter distributions on a range of benchmarks, challenging custom simulation environments and several real-world scenarios. Our experiments using ABB YuMi robot hardware show ability to help reinforcement learning approaches overcome cases of severe sim-to-real mismatch.

AB  - In the robotics literature, different knowledge transfer approaches have been proposed to leverage the experience from a source task or robot-real or virtual-to accelerate the learning process on a new task or robot. A commonly made but infrequently examined assumption is that incorporating experience from a source task or robot will be beneficial. In practice, inappropriate knowledge transfer can result in negative transfer or unsafe behaviour. In this work, inspired by a system gap metric from robust control theory, the Î½-gap, we present a data-efficient algorithm for estimating the similarity between pairs of robot systems. In a multi-source inter-robot transfer learning setup, we show that this similarity metric allows us to predict relative transfer performance and thus informatively select experiences from a source robot before knowledge transfer. We demonstrate our approach with quadrotor experiments, where we transfer an inverse dynamics model from a real or virtual source quadrotor to enhance the tracking performance of a target quadrotor on arbitrary hand-drawn trajectories. We show that selecting experiences based on the proposed similarity metric effectively facilitates the learning of the target quadrotor, improving performance by 62% compared to a poorly selected experience.

AB  - DeepRacer is a platform for end-to-end experimentation with RL and can be used to systematically investigate the key challenges in developing intelligent control systems. Using the platform, we demonstrate how a 1/18th scale car can learn to drive autonomously using RL with a monocular camera. It is trained in simulation with no additional tuning in the physical world and demonstrates: 1) formulation and solution of a robust reinforcement learning algorithm, 2) narrowing the reality gap through joint perception and dynamics, 3) distributed on-demand compute architecture for training optimal policies, and 4) a robust evaluation method to identify when to stop training. It is the first successful large-scale deployment of deep reinforcement learning on a robotic control agent that uses only raw camera images as observations and a model-free learning method to perform robust path planning. We open source our code and video demo on GitHub2.

AB  - Beyond the ultimate goal of prosthetics, repairing all the capabilities of amputees, the development line of upper-limb prostheses control mainly relies on three aspects: the robustness, the intuitiveness and the reduction of mental fatigue. Many complex structures and algorithms are proposed but no one question a common open-loop nature, where the user is the one in charge of correcting errors. Yet, closing the control loop at the prosthetic level may help to improve the three main lines of research cited above. One major issue to build a closed-loop control is the definition of a reliable error signal; this paper proposes to use body compensations, naturally exhibited by prostheses users when the motion of their device is inaccurate, as such. The described control scheme measures these compensatory movements and makes the prosthesis move in order to bring back the user into an ergonomic posture. The function of the prosthesis is no longer to perform a given motion but rather to correct the posture of its user while s/he focus on performing an endpoint task. This concept was validated and compared to a standard open-loop scheme, for the control of a prosthetic wrist, with five healthy subjects completing a dedicated task with a customized transradial prosthesis. Results show that the presented closed-loop control allows for more intuitiveness and less mental burden without enhancing body compensation.

AB  - Magnetic tracking algorithms can be used to determine the position and orientation of magnetic markers or devices. These techniques are particularly interesting for biomedical applications such as teleoperated surgical robots or the control of upper limb prostheses. The performance of different algorithms used for magnetic tracking was compared in the past. However, in most cases, those algorithms were required to track a single magnet.Here we investigated the performance of three localization algorithms in tracking up to 9 magnets: two optimization-based (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, LMA, and Trust Region Reflective algorithm, TRRA) and one recursion-based (Unscented Kalman Filter, UKF). The tracking accuracy of the algorithms and their computation time were investigated through simulations.The accuracy of the three algorithms, when tracking up to six magnets, was similar, leading to estimation errors varying from 0.06 Â± 0.02 mm to 2.26 Â± 0.07 mm within a 100 mm Ã 54 mm Ã 100 mm workspace, at the highest sampling frequency. In all cases, computation times under 300 ms for the UKF and 45 ms for the LMA/TRRA were obtained. The TRRA showed the best tracking performance overall.These outcomes are of interest for a wide range of robotics applications that require remote tracking.

AB  - We present a congestion-aware routing solution for indoor evacuation, which produces real-time individual-customized evacuation routes among multiple destinations while keeping tracks of all evacuees' locations. A population density map, obtained on-the-fly by aggregating locations of evacuees from user-end Augmented Reality (AR) devices, is used to model the congestion distribution inside a building. To efficiently search the evacuation route among all destinations, a variant of A* algorithm is devised to obtain the optimal solution in a single pass. In a series of simulated studies, we show that the proposed algorithm is more computationally optimized compared to classic path planning algorithms; it generates a more time-efficient evacuation route for each individual that minimizes the overall congestion. A complete system using AR devices is implemented for a pilot study in real-world environments, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

The developed system is based on the HoloLens glasses connected through Robotic Operation System to Unity engine and robotic manipulators. The system gives a possibility to recognize the real robot location by the point cloud analysis, to use virtual markers and menus for the task creation, to generate a trajectory for execution in the simulator or on the real manipulator. It also provides the possibility of scaling virtual and real worlds for more accurate planning. The proposed framework has been tested on pick-and-place and contact operations execution by UR10e and KUKA iiwa robots.

AB  - Heart rate monitoring at home is a useful metric for assessing health e.g. of the elderly or patients in post-operative recovery. Although non-contact heart rate monitoring has been widely explored, typically using a static, wall-mounted device, measurements are limited to a single room and sensitive to user orientation and position. In this work, we propose mBeats, a robot mounted millimeter wave (mmWave) radar system that provide periodic heart rate measurements under different user poses, without interfering in a users daily activities. mBeats contains a mmWave servoing module that adaptively adjusts the sensor angle to the best reflection pro le. Furthermore, mBeats features a deep neural network predictor, which can estimate heart rate from the lower leg and additionally provides estimation uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate accurate and robust operation of mBeats in a range of scenarios. We believe by integrating mobility and adaptability, mBeats can empower many down-stream healthcare applications at home, such as palliative care, post-operative rehabilitation and telemedicine.

AB  - Gait training is widely used to treat gait abnormalities. Traditional gait measurement systems are limited to instrumented laboratories. Even though gait measurements can be made in these settings, it is challenging to estimate gait parameters robustly in real-time for gait rehabilitation, especially when walking over-ground. In this paper, we present a novel approach to track the continuous gait cycle during overground walking outside the laboratory. In this approach, we instrument standard footwear with a sensorized insole and an inertial measurement unit. Artificial neural networks are used on the raw data obtained from the insoles and IMUs to compute the continuous percentage of the gait cycle for the entire walking session. We show in this paper that when tested with novel subjects, we can predict the gait cycle with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.2%. The onset of each cycle can be detected within an RMSE time of 41.5 ms with a 99% detection rate. The algorithm was tested with 18840 strides collected from 24 adults. In this paper, we tested a combination of fully-connected layers, an Encoder-Decoder using convolutional layers, and recurrent layers to identify an architecture that provided the best performance.

AB  - Biped robots require massive power on each leg while walking, hopping, and running. We have developed a flow-based control system-called hydraulic direct drive system- that can achieve high output while avoiding spatial limitations. To implement the proposed system with simple equipment configuration, a pump and single-rod cylinder are connected in a closed loop. However, because compensation for flow rate is impossible in a completely closed loop, owing to the difference in the pressure receiving area caused by the rod, a passive flow compensation valve is employed. This valve has a simple structure and is easy to implement. Further, an additional sensor is required to detect the open/close state because the valve state will cause an error in flow control. Therefore, we implemented a model in the controller to predict the state of the flow compensation valve and formulated a method of switching from flow control to pressure control according to the predicted state. Experimental results indicate that the error of the joint angle is reduced to less than 1.6 degrees for walking patterns, and stable walking is realized when the system is installed in biped humanoid robots.
