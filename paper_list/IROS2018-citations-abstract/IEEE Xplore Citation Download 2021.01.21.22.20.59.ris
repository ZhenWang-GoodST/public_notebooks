AB  - In this paper we develop a real-time human augmented mapping system. This approach replaces the traditional offline post processing of maps by a user-friendly system allowing for online editing capabilities. A wide number of applications that acquire accurate mapping of the environment could benefit from such a solution. The proposed framework consists of two main parts: 2D map building using LIDAR, encoders, and IMU; and a user interface for human map augmentation. The first part is built over Gmapping ROS package, while the second is developed in Unity software. Realworld experiments validated the ability of our system to correct for sensor noise and various mapping errors, thus increasing the accuracy of the obtained maps without additional computational costs.

AB  - We propose VLASE, a framework to use semantic edge features from images to achieve on-road localization. Semantic edge features denote edge contours that separate pairs of distinct objects such as building-sky, road-sidewalk, and building-ground. While prior work has shown promising results by utilizing the boundary between prominent classes such as sky and building using skylines, we generalize this to consider 19 semantic classes. We extract semantic edge features using CASENet architecture and utilize VLAD framework to perform image retrieval. We achieve improvement over state-of-the-art localization algorithms such as SIFT-VLAD and its deep variant NetVLAD. Ablation study shows the importance of different semantic classes, and our unified approach achieves better performance compared to individual prominent features such as skylines. We also introduce SLC Marathon dataset, a challenging dataset covering most of Salt Lake City with sufficient lighting variations.

AB  - This paper presents a 2D B-spline mapping framework for representing unstructured environments in a compact manner. While occupancy-grid and landmark-based maps have been successfully employed by the robotics community in indoor scenarios, outdoor long-term autonomous operations require a more compact representation of the environment. This work tackles this problem by interpolating the data of a high frequency sensor using B-spline curves. Compared to lines and circles, splines are more powerful in the sense that they allow for the description of more complex shapes in the scene. In this work, spline curves are continuously tracked and aligned across multiple sensor readings using lightweight methods, making the proposed framework suitable for robot navigation in outdoor missions. In particular, a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm specifically tailored for B-spline maps is presented here. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated by Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) simulations in different scenarios.

AB  - The ability to build models of the environment is an essential prerequisite for many robotic applications. In recent years, mapping of dense surface geometry using RGB-D cameras has seen extensive progress. Many approaches build colored models, typically directly using the intensity values provided by the camera. Unfortunately, these intensities are inherently affected by illumination. Therefore, the resulting maps only represent the environment for one specific lighting condition. To overcome this limitation, we propose to build reflectance maps that are invariant against changes in lighting. Our approach estimates the diffuse reflectance of a surface by recovering its radiosity and the corresponding irradiance. As imperfections in this process can significantly degrade the reflectance estimate, we remove outliers in the high dynamic range radiosity estimation and propose a method to refine the reflectance estimate. Our system implements the whole pipeline for offline reconstruction of dense reflectance maps including the segmentation of light emitters in the scene. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in real-world experiments under varying lighting conditions.

AB  - Automatic subsurface mapping is essential in the construction services, as it is anticipated to become the main operational environment of the future robots to be realized in the respective domain. Towards this direction, the paper at hand, introduces for the first time herein, an integrated framework for subsurface mapping by exploiting a surface operating mobile robot with a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). The mobile robot tows the GPR antenna, which is mounted on a specifically designed trailer, and is utilized as the mean to cover the surface area, while at the same time the antenna scans the subsurface by emitting electromagnetic pulses. The gathered data are processed for the construction of a subsurface 3D map. Specifically, image processing techniques, that involve background segmentation, HOG [1] feature extraction, hypothesis verification and matching are applied on the 2D radargram (B-Scan) for the detection of the salient points that correspond to buried utilities. By employing the pulse propagation velocity into the subsurface and the soil utilities, the salient points are expressed in world coordinates and used for the composition of the 3D subsurface map. Our method has been evaluated on a real test site, accompanied by ground-truth annotation data of experts and revealed remarkable performance, exhibiting not only the feasibility of underground mapping but also the capacity to obtain exploitable results for underground robotic applications.

AB  - State-of-the-art monocular dense mapping methods usually divide the image sequence into several separate multi-view stereo problems thus have limited utilization of the information in multi-baseline observations and sequential depth estimations. In this paper, two core contributions are proposed to improve the mapping performance by exploiting the information. The first is an adaptive baseline matching cost computation that uses the sequential input images to provide each pixel with wide-baseline observations. The second is a frame-to-frame propagated depth filter which integrates the sequential depth estimation of the same physical point in a robust probabilistic manner. Two contributions are integrated into a monocular dense mapping system that generates the depth maps in real-time for both pinhole and fisheye cameras. Our system is fully parallelized and can run at more than 25 fps on a Nvidia Jetson TX2. We compare our work with state-of-the-art methods on the public dataset. Onboard UAV mapping and handhold experiments are also used to demonstrate the performance of our method. For the benefit of the community, we make the implementation open source.

AB  - We propose an end-to-end real time framework to generate high resolution graphics grade textured 3D map of urban environment. The generated detailed map finds its application in the precise localization and navigation of autonomous vehicles. It can also serve as a virtual test bed for various vision and planning algorithms as well as a background map in the computer games. In this paper, we focus on two important issues: (i) incrementally generating a map with coherent 3D surface, in real time and (ii) preserving the quality of color texture. To handle the above issues, firstly, we perform a pose-refinement procedure which leverages camera image information, Delaunay triangulation and existing scan matching techniques to produce high resolution 3D map from the sparse input LIDAR scan. This 3D map is then texturized and accumulated by using a novel technique of ray-filtering which handles occlusion and inconsistencies in pose-refinement. Further, inspired by human fovea, we introduce foveal-processing which significantly reduces the computation time and also assists ray-filtering to maintain consistency in color texture and coherency in 3D surface of the output map. Moreover, we also introduce texture error (TE) and mean texture mapping error (MTME), which provides quantitative measure of texturing and overall quality of the textured maps.

AB  - Robots often have to deal with the challenges of operating in dynamic and sometimes unpredictable environments. Although an occupancy map of the environment is sufficient for navigation of a mobile robot or manipulation tasks with a robotic arm in static environments, robots operating in dynamic environments demand richer information to improve robustness, efficiency, and safety. For instance, in path planning, it is important to know the direction of motion of dynamic objects at various locations of the environment for safer navigation or human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce directional statistics into robotic mapping to model circular data. Primarily, in collateral to occupancy grid maps, we propose directional grid maps to represent the location-wide long-term angular motion of the environment. Being highly representative, this defines a probability measure-field over the longitude-latitude space rather than a scalar-field or a vector-field. Withal, we further demonstrate how the same theory can be used to model angular variations in the spatial domain, temporal domain, and spatiotemporal domain. We carried out a series of experiments to validate the proposed models using a variety of robots having different sensors such as RGB cameras and LiDARs on simulated and real-world settings in both indoor and outdoor environments.

AB  - Swing Leg Retraction (SLR) is observed in human walking and running. Previous studies have concluded that SLR improves the stability and robustness of biped walking. But this conclusion was based on analysis of robot models that can only walk at a very small range of step-lengths and slow or fixed speeds. By contrast, humans can walk with a large range of speeds and step-lengths. Moreover, human walking patterns have a special feature that has not been considered in the previous studies on SLR effects: At a given walking speed, v, humans prefer a step-length, s, which satisfies the power law, s-vÎ². Therefore, previous studies on SLR can't tell us whether their conclusion will still hold in the full range of human walking patterns (i.e., various walking speeds and step-lengths). This is the question we want to answer in this paper. In this study, using a simple biped model, we studied how the SLR affects the walking stability in the full range of human walking speeds/step-lengths. Preliminary analysis of both models suggests the same conclusion: (1) SLR improves the stability more evidently in human-preferred walking patterns than in other walking patterns. (2) In walking patterns that are very unlike human-preferred ones, the SLR improves the stability very little, or even deteriorates it drastically. Therefore, the new finding of our study is that how the SLR affects the biped walking stability depends on the walking speed and step-length. SLR does not always improve the stability of biped walking.

AB  - Quadrupedal trotting gaits of constant forward velocity and body height are studied. A method is developed, which is structured upon analytical expressions derived from the dynamics of a reduced single-legged model comprised of a point mass, and two actuated rotational joints. The inputs of the method include the robot mass, the leg and actuator properties, and the desired forward velocity, yielding all robot body feasible trajectories and their energy footprints. Thus, the method predicts the maximum forward velocity of a trotting quadruped; it also suggests energetically optimal combinations of body height and step length for a given forward velocity.

AB  - The dolphin kick is a swimming style characterized by undulation of the body. As a platform for swimming research, we have developed a musculoskeletal humanoid robot called Triton. Triton has a flexible spine with erector spinae muscles and a stiffness adjustment system for lumbar joints. The musculoskeletal body includes biarticular and polyarticular muscles, providing multi-joint coordination. The robot is actuated by pneumatic muscles, yielding lightweight and inherently waterproof properties. The compliance of the joints allows interactions between body and fluid similar to those of human swimming. This study presents the design concept of Triton and experimental results from a water tank test. We compare the results with simulation and human movements reported in literature. The results show that the musculoskeletal swimming robot has similar cycle trends in joint angle and thrust force.

AB  - Wheel-legged hybrid robot with multi-modal locomotion can efficiently adapt to different terrain environments, as well as realize rapid maneuver on flat ground. We have developed a novel hydraulic wheel-legged robot (WLR) combined with a humanoid structural design. This robot can assist to emergency scenarios where the high mobility, adaptability and robustness are required. The paper introduces the details of the WLR, highlighting the innovative design and optimization of physical construction which is considered to maximize the mobile abilities, enhance the environmental adaptability and improve the reliability of hydraulic system. Firstly, maximizing the mobile abilities includes optimizing the configuration of each actuator and integrating them with the structure, so as to achieve a large range of movement and also reduce the mass and inertia of the legs. Secondly, the environmental adaptability can be ensured with a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based damper and direct-drive wheels. Thirdly, improving the reliability of hydraulic system involves using the selective laser melting (SLM) technology to integrate hydraulic system and reducing the number of exposed tubes. The maneuverability of the WLR is demonstrated with a series of experiments. At present, the WLR can perform the following operations, including moving on the flat ground, squatting, and picking up a heavy load.

AB  - We demonstrate the physical rearrangement of wheeled stools in a moderately cluttered indoor environment by a quadrupedal robot that autonomously achieves a user's desired configuration. The robot's behaviors are planned and executed by a three layer hierarchical architecture consisting of: an offline symbolic task and motion planner; a reactive layer that tracks the reference output of the deliberative layer and avoids unanticipated obstacles sensed online; and a gait layer that realizes the abstract unicycle commands from the reactive module through appropriately coordinated joint level torque feedback loops. This work also extends prior formal results about the reactive layer to a broad class of nonconvex obstacles. Our design is verified both by formal proofs as well as empirical demonstration of various assembly tasks.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of assist-as-needed (AAN) control for rehabilitation robots. To achieve a motion which is not explicitly a function of time, the velocity field control is considered in this paper. The proposed new controller consists of a proportional-like feedback term and a neural network (NN) term, where the later is exploited to compensate for the dynamic uncertainties of the system. The AAN property is facilitated by means of a dead-zone function in the feedback control term and a forgetting factor in the adaptation law of NN component. The designed controller guarantees the stability of the system with a bounded control command. The performance of the proposed AAN scheme is validated through the simulation and experiment conducted on a lower-limb exoskeleton.

AB  - The development and control of prosthetic hands is an active research area and recently progress in mechatronics, sensor integration and innovative control has been made. However, integration of different components into a prosthetic hand remains challenging due to space constraints, the requirements regarding holistic integration and the need for a user interface. In this paper, we present the KIT prosthetic hand, a novel five-finger 3D printed hand prosthesis, with its underactuated mechanism, sensors and embedded control system. The hand mechanics is based on the underactuated TUAT/Karlsruhe mechanism with two motors actuating 10 degrees of freedom. The mechanism has been realized in 3D printing technologies to facilitate a personalization of the prosthetic hand in terms of size and kinematic parameters. The prosthesis has been designed as a 50th percentile male hand. It integrates an advanced embedded system as well as an RGB camera in the base of the palm and a colour display in the back of the hand. Experiments indicate a finger tip force of 7.48 N to 11.82 N, a hook grasp force of 120 N and a hand closing time of ~ 1.3 s.

AB  - Standing on a beam is a challenging motor skill that requires the regulation of upright balance and stability. In this paper, we analyzed the behavior of humans balancing on a narrow beam without footwear. The results revealed high anti-correlation between lumped upper- and lower-body angular momentum. Despite differences in gross measures of balance, interlimb coordination was consistent between the novice and expert subjects, suggesting that both performances could be described with the same balance controller. By simulating a double inverted pendulum model utilizing different balancing controllers described in the robotics literature, we identified that the whole behavior observed from humans standing on a beam was best replicated with controllers that predominantly utilized hip actuation.

AB  - The goal of this research is to develop a lower-extremity wearable link mechanism (i.e., exoskeleton robot) that is capable of reducing load against targeted body parts such as bones, joints and muscles, for shock absorption that help to support exploration of extreme environments. One of the applications of such exoskeleton is to protect a pilot of a personal vertical mobility system, or JetPack, when landing. The shock absorbing exoskeleton is to introduce series and parallel viscoelasticity to the human skeletal system. The paper presents a pilot study to validate this body-protective exoskeleton concept by analyzing kinematic and dynamic models of a human-exoskeleton coupled system based on a multi-element viscoelastic model in rheology. A proof-of-concept prototype is developed and experimental data is presented.

AB  - Human-robot interaction strongly benefits from fast, predictive action recognition. For us this is relatively easy but difficult for a robot. To address this problem, here we present a novel prediction algorithm for manipulation action classes in video sequences. Manipulations are first represented using the Enriched Semantic Event Chain (ESEC) framework. This creates a temporal sequence of static and dynamic spatial relations between the objects that take part in the manipulation by which an action can be quickly recognized. We measured performance on 32 ideal as well as real manipulations and compared our method also against a state of the art trajectory-based HMM method for action recognition. We observe that manipulations can be correctly predicted after only (on average) 45% of action's total time and that we are almost twice as fast as the HMM-based method. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of this framework in a simple robot demonstration comparing two different approaches.

AB  - Accurate long-term prediction of human motion in populated spaces is an important but difficult task for mobile robots and intelligent vehicles. What makes this task challenging is that human motion is influenced by a large variety of factors including the person's intention, the presence, attributes, actions, social relations and social norms of other surrounding agents, and the geometry and semantics of the environment. In this paper, we consider the problem of computing human motion predictions that account for such factors. We formulate the task as an MDP planning problem with stochastic policies and propose a weighted random walk algorithm in which each agent is locally influenced by social forces from other nearby agents. The novelty of this paper is that we incorporate social grouping information into the prediction process reflecting the soft formation constraints that groups typically impose to their members' motion. We show that our method makes more accurate predictions than three state-of-the-art methods in terms of probabilistic and geometrical performance metrics.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a risk-based coordination method for the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem in human-populated environments. We introduce risk-based bids that incorporate human trajectory prediction uncertainties and furthermore, social costs in their formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of including a predictive component in the risk formulation despite the lack of accurate position estimation for humans through an extensive suite of experiments. This is done by means of testing different levels of prediction error for known human trajectories and in a separate approach, using a Kalman filter for human trajectory estimation. Furthermore, we propose different risk formulations and evaluate their performance in a high-fidelity simulator. Additionally, a comparative study targeting human-agnostic planning at both navigation and planning levels, human-aware navigation and planning based on deterministic costs, and risk-based human-aware planning with no individual human-aware navigation has been conducted. Results confirm that risk-based bids lead to more socially acceptable team plans that reduce the need for the lower level individual human-aware navigation to be activated. Risk-based plans accounting for social costs prevent difficult social situations that can lead to less effective human-aware navigation, such as traversing narrow passages occupied by humans.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a method to model social interaction between a human and a virtual avatar. To this end, two human performers fist perform social interactions according to the Learning from Demonstration paradigm. Then, the relative relevance of all joints of both performers should be reasonably modeled based on human demonstrations. However, among all possible combinations of relative joints, it is necessary to select only some of the combinations that play key roles in social interaction. We select such significant features based on the joint motion significance, which is a metric to measure the significance degree by calculating both temporal entropy and spatial entropy of all human joints from a Gaussian mixture model. To evaluate our proposed method, we performed experiments on five social interactions: hand shaking, hand slapping, shoulder holding, object passing, and target kicking. In addition, we compared our method to existing modeling methods using different metrics, such as principal component analysis and information gain.

In this paper, we explore the effects of integrating both the robot's ability to generate intentional motion and predict the human's motion in a collaborative physical task. We implemented an intent recognition system to recognize the human partner's hand motion intent and a motion planner system to enable the robot to communicate its intent by using legible and predictable motion. We tested this bi-directional intent system in a 2-way within-subjects user study. Results suggest that an integrated intent recognition and communication system may facilitate more collaborative behavior among team members.

AB  - We propose and test an autonomous robot behavior for socially-compliant navigation of doorways with both human and robot interlocutors. Building on previous work for âaggressiveâ interaction between robots to resolve navigation deadlocks in corridors, we demonstrate an âassertiveâ robot that negotiates right-of-way when faced with a human or other robot. The negotiation is implemented using only motion and common navigation sensors, without explicit message-passing. Our goal is for the correct agent to take priority, as decided both by time-efficiency and as judged subjectively by naive human participants. Our contribution is a practical method for doorway negotiation, and a study of human users' responses to a robot that appears to participate in existing social customs surrounding doors. Our method is evaluated with robot-robot experiments and a human-robot interaction study with nonexpert users.

AB  - In times of more and more complex interaction techniques, we point out the powerfulness of colored light as a simple and cheap feedback mechanism. Since it is visible over a distance and does not interfere with other modalities, it is especially interesting for mobile robots. In an online survey, we asked 56 participants to choose the most appropriate colors for scenarios that were presented in the form of videos. In these scenarios a mobile robot accomplished tasks, in some with success, in others it failed because the task is not feasible, in others it stopped because it waited for help. We analyze in what way the color preferences differ between these three categories. The results show a connection between colors and meanings and that it depends on the participants' technical affinity, experience with robots and gender how clear the color preference is for a certain category. Finally, we found out that the participants' favorite color is not related to color preferences.

AB  - The present study highlights the benefits of using well-controlled experimental designs, grounded in experimental psychology research and objective neuroscientific methods, for generating progress in human-robot interaction (HRI) research. More specifically, we aimed at implementing a well-studied paradigm of attentional cueing through gaze (the so-called âjoint attentionâ or âgaze cueingâ) in an HRI protocol involving the iCub robot. Similarly to documented results in gaze-cueing research, we found faster response times and enhanced event-related potentials of the EEG signal for discrimination of cued, relative to uncued, targets. These results are informative for the robotics community by showing that a humanoid robot with mechanistic eyes and human-like characteristics of the face is in fact capable of engaging a human in joint attention to a similar extent as another human would do. More generally, we propose that the methodology of combining neuroscience methods with an HRI protocol, contributes to understanding mechanisms of human social cognition in interactions with robots and to improving robot design, thanks to systematic and well-controlled experimentation tapping onto specific cognitive mechanisms of the human, such as joint attention.

AB  - This paper introduces a map-based localization method aiming to increase robustness in rainy conditions. This method utilizes two types of features: ground reflectivity features and vertical features extracted from 3D LIDAR scans and builds vehicle pose belief with two filters: a histogram filter and a particle filter. The posterior distributions from the two filters are integrated to estimate vehicle poses. This method exploits advantages of both features and filters, compensating respective weakness to deal with complex urban environments. Testing was performed in the fair and rainy weather. Road test results prove robustness and reliability of the proposed method.

MBF provides modular actions for executing plugins for path planning, motion control, and recovery. These actions define interfaces for external executives to allow highly flexible navigation strategies, which can be intertwined with other robot tasks. MBF has been successfully deployed in a professional setting at customer facilities to control robots in highly dynamic environments. We compare MBF with the well-known move_base and present the architecture as well as different deployment approaches, including how MBF can be used with different executives to perform complex navigation tasks interleaved with other robot operations.

AB  - Emergency trajectories enable one to move faster through an environment while still moving safely. Having an emergency trajectory within an observed vacant space makes it possible to safely navigate through unknown territory or through a door without slowing down. Emergency trajectories allow for safe navigation of a vehicle into a safe system state, e.g. a stop, in the event of recognition of an obstacle. This work formally proves the benefit of using emergency trajectories to generate safe and faster motion controls as compared to vehicle operation without such trajectories. Furthermore, this work also presents a working integration of this formalism into a vehicle's low level control system in a Moving Horizon Trajectory Planner (MHTP) with an update rate of 10Hz. Using an MHTP along with a dynamic model of the environment and the proposed constraints, the system is able to derive emergency trajectory candidates which fulfill our safety requirements. This distinguishes the approach from that of others, which replans discrete paths that are then followed by the vehicle's local control system. This approach was implemented on a differential-drive mobile agent and tested using non-static environment assumptions. Simulated and real-robot experimental results illustrate the quality of our approach.

AB  - Reliable long-term localization is key for robotic systems in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for long-term localization using 3D LiDARs, coined PoseMap. In essence, we extract distinctive features from range measurements and bundle these into local views along with observation poses. The sensor's trajectory is then estimated in a sliding window fashion by matching current and old features and minimizing the distances in-between. The map representation facilitates finding a suitable set of old features, by selecting the closest local map(s) for matching. Similarly to a visibility analysis, this procedure provides a suitable set of features for localization but at a fraction of the computational cost. PoseMap also allows for updates and extensions of the map at any time by replacing and adding local maps when necessary. We evaluate our approach using two platforms both equipped with a 3D LiDAR and an IMU, demonstrating localization at 8 Hz and robustness to changes in the environment such as moving vehicles and changing vegetation. PoseMap was implemented on an autonomous vehicle allowing it to drive autonomously over a period of 18 months through a mix of industrial and unstructured off-road environments, covering more than 100 kms without a single localization failure.

AB  - In this paper we present a data driven approach for safe and smooth autonomous navigation of a personal mobility vehicle (PMV) when facing moving obstacles such as people and bicycles in public pedestrian paths. In a period of three months, data from five different persons driving the robotic PMV in an outdoor environment while facing pedestrians were collected. 2465 clean tracks around the vehicle together with PMVs trajectories were collected. We performed an analysis of the parameters involved for human-driven smooth navigation. Relevant parameters regarding PMV-Human interaction included distance to moving objects, passing side and velocities. Moreover, data suggests the existence of a social navigational distance for the PWv. For autonomous navigation we implemented a Frenet planner to achieve safe and smooth navigation for the passenger and pedestrians around. Experimental results in real pedestrian paths show that the PMV is capable of smoothly following its path while facing pedestrians and bicycles.

We propose a novel set of features that can be easily extracted from car trajectories. We derive a data-driven mapping between these features and six driver behaviors using an elaborate web-based user study. We also compute a summarized score indicating a level of awareness that is needed while driving next to other vehicles. We also incorporate our algorithm into a vehicle navigation simulation system and demonstrate its benefits in terms of safer realtime navigation, while driving next to aggressive or dangerous drivers.

This paper further reports the application of the identified plant models in combined underwater communication and navigation (cooperative navigation) of UVs. We report an approach to model identification that simultaneously identifies 6-DOF UV nonlinear plant-model parameters, control-surface parameters, and thruster-model parameters. We believe this approach is suitable for identifying plant model parameters from data obtained in full-scale experimental trials of UVs in controlled motion. The reported approach to nonlinear model identification of UVs is evaluated in simulation studies. The resulting identified UV plant models are further evaluated in simulated cooperative navigation missions of the UV that are representative of high-precision survey missions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first method to identify 6-DOF UV model parameters, control-surface parameters, and thruster-model parameters simultaneously.

AB  - Behavior trees (BT) are a popular control architecture in the computer game industry, and have been more recently applied in robotics. One open question is how can intelligent agents/robots autonomously acquire their behavior trees for task level control? In contrast with existing approaches that either refine an initially given BT, or directly build the BT based on human feedback/demonstration, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) that allows robots to autonomously learn control policies by repeated task interaction, but often expressed in a language more difficult to interpret than BTs. The learned control policy is then converted to a behavior tree via our proposed decanonicalization algorithm. The feasibility of this idea is based on a proposed notion of canonical behavior trees (CBT). In particular, we show (1) CBTs are sufficiently expressive to capture RL control policies, and (2) that RL can be independent of an optimal behavior permutation, despite the BT convention of left-to-right priority, thus obviating the need for a combinatorial search. Two evaluation domains help illustrate our approach.

AB  - Assessing grasp stability is essential to prevent the failure of robotic manipulation tasks due to sensory data and object uncertainties. Learning-based approaches are widely deployed to infer the success of a grasp. Typically, the underlying model used to estimate the grasp stability is trained for a specific task, such as lifting, hand-over, or pouring. Since every task has individual stability demands, it is important to adapt the trained model to new manipulation actions. If the same trained model is directly applied to a new task, unnecessary grasp adaptations might be triggered, or in the worst case, the manipulation might fail. To address this issue, we divide the manipulation task used for training into seven sub-tasks, defined as modular tasks. We deploy a learning-based approach and assess the stability for each modular task separately. We further propose analytical features to reduce the dimensionality and the redundancy of the tactile sensor readings. A main task can thereby be represented as a sequence of relevant modular tasks. The stability prediction of the main task is computed based on the inferred success labels of the modular tasks. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed feature set lowers the prediction error up to 5.69% compared to other sets used in state-of-the-art methods. Robotic experiments demonstrate that our modular task-oriented stability assessment avoids unnecessary grasp force adaptations and regrasps for various manipulation tasks.

AB  - In this paper, we address the challenge of robotic manipulation of elastically deforming objects. To this end, we model elastic objects using the Finite Element Method. Through a quasi-static assumption, we leverage sensitivity analysis to mathematically model how changes in the robot's configuration affect the deformed shape of the object being manipulated. This enables an interactive, simulation-based control methodology, wherein user-specified deformations for the elastic objects are automatically mapped to joint angle commands. The optimization formulation we introduce is general, operates directly within a robot's workspace and can readily incorporate joint limits as well as collision avoidance between the links. We validate our control methodology on a YuMiÂ® IRB 14000, which we use to manipulate a variety of elastic objects.

AB  - Deep learning-based robotic grasping has made significant progress thanks to algorithmic improvements and increased data availability. However, state-of-the-art models are often trained on as few as hundreds or thousands of unique object instances, and as a result generalization can be a challenge. In this work, we explore a novel data generation pipeline for training a deep neural network to perform grasp planning that applies the idea of domain randomization to object synthesis. We generate millions of unique, unrealistic procedurally generated objects, and train a deep neural network to perform grasp planning on these objects. Since the distribution of successful grasps for a given object can be highly multimodal, we propose an autoregressive grasp planning model that maps sensor inputs of a scene to a probability distribution over possible grasps. This model allows us to sample grasps efficiently at test time (or avoid sampling entirely). We evaluate our model architecture and data generation pipeline in simulation and the real world. We find we can achieve a >90% success rate on previously unseen realistic objects at test time in simulation despite having only been trained on random objects. We also demonstrate an 80% success rate on real-world grasp attempts despite having only been trained on random simulated objects.

AB  - Many of the solutions proposed for the object manipulation problem are based on the knowledge of the object features. The approach proposed in this paper intends to provide a simple geometrical approach to securely manipulate an unknown object based only on tactile and kinematic information. The tactile and kinematic data obtained during the manipulation is used to recognize the object shape (at least the local object curvature), allowing to improve the grasping forces when this information is added to the manipulation strategy. The approach has been fully implemented and tested using the Schunk Dexterous Hand (SDH2). Experimental results are shown to illustrate the efficiency of the approach.

AB  - Deep learning has been successful in a variety of applications that have high-dimensional state spaces such as object recognition, video games, and machine translation. Deep neural networks can automatically learn important features from high-dimensional state given large training datasets. However, the success of deep learning in robot systems in the realworld is limited due to the cost of obtaining these large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose an information-theoretic, intrinsically motivated, self-labeling mechanism using closed-loop control states. Taking this approach biases exploration to informative interactions-as such, a robot requires much less training to achieve reliable performance. In this paper, we explore the impact such an approach has on learning how to grasp objects. We evaluate different intrinsic motivators present in the literature applied appropriately in our framework and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each.

AB  - We present a manipulation planning algorithm for a robot to keep an object stable under changing external forces. We particularly focus on the case where a human may be applying forceful operations, e.g. cutting or drilling, on an object that the robot is holding. The planner produces an efficient plan by intelligently deciding when the robot should change its grasp on the object as the human applies the forces. The planner also tries to choose subsequent grasps such that they will minimize the number of regrasps that will be required in the long-term. Furthermore, as it switches from one grasp to the other, the planner solves the problem of bimanual regrasp planning, where the object is not placed on a support surface, but instead it is held by a single gripper until the second gripper moves to a new position on the object. This requires the planner to also reason about the stability of the object under gravity. We provide an implementation on a bimanual robot and present experiments to show the performance of our planner.

AB  - Grasping skill is a major ability that a wide number of real-life applications require for robotisation. State-of-the-art robotic grasping methods perform prediction of object grasp locations based on deep neural networks. However, such networks require huge amount of labeled data for training making this approach often impracticable in robotics. In this paper, we propose a method to generate a large scale synthetic dataset with ground truth, which we refer to as the Jacquard grasping dataset. Jacquard is built on a subset of ShapeNet, a large CAD models dataset, and contains both RGB-D images and annotations of successful grasping positions based on grasp attempts performed in a simulated environment. We carried out experiments using an off-the-shelf CNN, with three different evaluation metrics, including real grasping robot trials. The results show that Jacquard enables much better generalization skills than a human labeled dataset thanks to its diversity of objects and grasping positions. For the purpose of reproducible research in robotics, we are releasing along with the Jacquard dataset a web interface for researchers to evaluate the successfulness of their grasping position detections using our dataset.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of obtaining human-like motions on hand-arm robotic systems performing grasping actions. The focus is set on the coordinated movements of the robotic arm and the anthropomorphic mechanical hand, with which the arm is equipped. For this, human movements performing different grasps are captured and mapped to the robot in order to compute the human hand synergies. These synergies are used to both obtain human-like movements and to reduce the complexity of the planning phase by reducing the dimension of the search space. In addition, the paper proposes a sampling-based planner, which guides the motion planning following the synergies and considering different types of grasps. The introduced approach is tested in an application example and thoroughly compared with a state-of-the-art planning algorithm, obtaining better results.

AB  - Safe motion planning requires that a vehicle reaches a set of safe states at the end of the planning horizon. However, safe states of vehicles have not yet been systematically defined in the literature, nor does a computationally efficient way to obtain them for online motion planning exist. To tackle the aforementioned issues, we introduce invariably safe sets. These are regions that allow vehicles to remain safe for an infinite time horizon. We show how invariably safe sets can be computed and propose a tight under-approximation which can be obtained efficiently in linear time with respect to the number of traffic participants. We use invariably safe sets to lift safety verification from finite to infinite time horizons. In addition, our sets can be used to determine the existence of feasible evasive maneuvers and the criticality of scenarios by computing the time-to-react metric.

AB  - A common solution criterion for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is to maximize the expected sum of exponentially discounted rewards, for which a variety of approximate methods have been proposed. Those that plan in the belief space typically provide tighter performance guarantees, but those that plan over the state space (e.g., QMDP and FIB) often require much less memory and computation. This paper presents an encouraging result that shows that reducing the discount factor while planning in the state space can actually improve performance significantly when evaluated on the original problem. This phenomenon is confirmed by both a theoretical analysis as well as a series of empirical studies on benchmark problems. As predicted by the theory and confirmed empirically, the phenomenon is most prominent when the observation model is noisy or rewards are sparse.

AB  - We study the ambiguous data association problem confronting simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), specifically for the autonomous exploration of environments lacking rich features. In such environments, a single false positive assignment might lead to catastrophic failure, which even robust back-ends may be unable to resolve. Inspired by multiple hypothesis tracking, we present a novel approach to effectively manage multiple hypotheses (MH) of data association inherited from traditional joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB), which entails the generation, ordering and elimination of hypotheses. We analyze the performance of MHJCBB in two particular situations, one applying it to SLAM over a predefined trajectory and the other showing its applicability in exploring unknown environments. Statistical results demonstrate that MHJCBB's maintenance of diverse hypotheses under ambiguous conditions significantly improves map accuracy.

AB  - In unknown, cluttered environments, robots require online real-time mapping and collision checking in order to navigate robustly. Discrete map representations are inefficient for collision checking as they are expensive in terms of memory and computation. This paper takes a probabilistic approach to local mapping by representing the environment as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and leverages its geometric properties to enable efficient collision checking given a time-parameterized trajectory. In contrast to current discretization-based methods, a GMM preserves geometric coverage of the environment without losing representation accuracy with varying map resolutions. We introduce a novel GMM local mapping algorithm that can be used with a single depth camera processed on a single CPU, and provide algorithms for collision avoidance given arbitrary trajectory representations. Finally, we provide experimentation results demonstrating safety, efficiency, and data coverage for real-time collision avoidance with a quadrotor navigating in a cluttered environment.

AB  - In partially observed environments, it can be useful for a human to provide the robot with declarative information that represents probabilistic relational constraints on properties of objects in the world, augmenting the robot's sensory observations. For instance, a robot tasked with a search-and-rescue mission may be informed by the human that two victims are probably in the same room. An important question arises: how should we represent the robot's internal knowledge so that this information is correctly processed and combined with raw sensory information? In this paper, we provide an efficient belief state representation that dynamically selects an appropriate factoring, combining aspects of the belief when they are correlated through information and separating them when they are not. This strategy works in open domains, in which the set of possible objects is not known in advance, and provides significant improvements in inference time over a static factoring, leading to more efficient planning for complex partially observed tasks. We validate our approach experimentally in two open-domain planning problems: a 2D discrete gridworld task and a 3D continuous cooking task.

AB  - We propose novel techniques for task allocation and planning in multi-robot systems operating in uncertain environments. Task allocation is performed simultaneously with planning, which provides more detailed information about individual robot behaviour, but also exploits independence between tasks to do so efficiently. We use Markov decision processes to model robot behaviour and linear temporal logic to specify tasks and safety constraints. Building upon techniques and tools from formal verification, we show how to generate a sequence of multi-robot policies, iteratively refining them to reallocate tasks if individual robots fail, and providing probabilistic guarantees on the performance (and safe operation) of the team of robots under the resulting policy. We implement our approach and evaluate it on a benchmark multi-robot example.

AB  - In challenging environments where human intervention is expensive, robust and persistent autonomy is a key requirement. AI Planners can efficiently construct plans to achieve this long-term autonomous behaviour. However, in plans which are expected to last over days, or even weeks, the size of the state-space becomes too large for current planners to solve as a single problem. These problems are well-suited to decomposition and abstraction planning techniques. We present a novel approach in the context of persistent autonomy in autonomous underwater vehicles, in which tasks are complex and diverse and plans cannot be precomputed. Our approach performs a decomposition into a two-level hierarchical structure, which dynamically constructs planning problems at the upper level of the hierarchy using solution plans from the lower level. Solution plans are then executed and monitored simultaneously at both levels. We evaluate the approach, showing that compared to strictly top-down hierarchical decompositions, our approach leads to more robust solution plans of higher quality.

AB  - This paper presents the motion planning framework for a hexapod, based on advanced motions, for accessing challenging spaces, namely narrow pathways and large holes, both of which are surrounded by walls. The advanced motions, wall and chimney walking, utilise environment surfaces that are perpendicular to the ground plane to support the robot motion. Such techniques have not yet been studied in the literature. The hierarchical planning framework proposed here is an extension to existing approaches which have only considered ground walking where foothold contacts are confined to the ground plane. During the pre-processing phase of the 2.5D grid map, the motion primitives employed are assessed for each cell and stacked to the graph if valid. The A* algorithm is then used to find a path to the goal position. Following that, the path is post-processed to smoothen the motions and generate a continuous path. Footholds are then selected along the path. The framework has been evaluated in simulation on the custom-designed Corin hexapod. The resulting path enables access to areas that are previously thought to be inaccessible and reduces the travelling distance compared to previous studies.

AB  - This paper presents, for the first time, a method for learning in-contact tasks from a teleoperated demonstration with a hydraulic manipulator. Due to the use of extremely powerful hydraulic manipulator, a force-reflected bilateral teleoperation is the most reasonable method of giving a human demonstration. An advanced subsystem-dynamic-based control design framework, virtual decomposition control (VDC), is used to design a stability-guaranteed controller for the teleoperation system, while taking into account the full nonlinear dynamics of the master and slave manipulators. The use of fragile force/torque sensor at the tip of the hydraulic slave manipulator is avoided by estimating the contact forces from the manipulator actuators' chamber pressures. In the proposed learning method, it is observed that a surface-sliding tool has a friction-dependent range of directions (between the actual direction of motion and the contact force) from which the manipulator can apply force to produce the sliding motion. By this intuition, an intersection of these ranges can be taken over a motion to robustly find a desired direction for the motion from one or more demonstrations. The compliant axes required to reproduce the motion can be found by assuming that all motions outside the desired direction is caused by the environment, signalling the need for compliance. Finally, the learning method is incorporated to a novel VDC-based impedance control method to learn compliant behaviour from teleoperated human demonstrations. Experiments with 2-DOF hydraulic manipulator with a 475kg payload demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed method to perform learning from demonstration (LfD) with heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators.

AB  - Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) is the world's first fully superconducting tokamak fusion device with non-circular cross-section which was built in China The EAST articulated maintenance arm (EAMA) system is developed for real-time detection and rapid repair operations to damaged internal components during plasma discharges without breaking the EAST ultra-high vacuum (UHV) condition. To achieve the desired objectives, the EAMA system design should guarantee that the robot can stably run in the harsh environments of high temperature (80-120 Â°C) and high vacuum (~ 10-5Pa). Meanwhile, the errors caused by the deformation of long flexible robot arms should also be predicted and compensated in real-time to obtain high accuracy for maintenance operations. In this paper, the vacuum-available design scheme of the manipulator system was firstly introduced. Secondly, inverse kinematics and obstacle avoidance strategy of the highly redundant EAMA robot was built. Then, flexible errors were predicted utilizing a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model which was established on the basis of real experimental data. Finally, an integrated control strategy for error prediction and compensation was developed.

AB  - Characterisation of nuclear environments is critical for long term operation and decommissioning. Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is an example of a scientific instrument that could be deployed to aid in characterisation of unknown environments. LIBS consists of a high intensity pulsed laser being focussed down onto a target to create a plasma, and optical emission from the plasma is then used to determine elemental composition of unknown materials. For robots deployed with these instruments in extreme environments, mission time can be limited by hazards present such as radiation. Once deployed a robot must be able to collect the best data possible whilst maximising operational runtime. We present a data quality based probabilistic approach to robot pose estimation to maximise data quality, by considering optimum sensor placement whilst avoiding harmful environmental features such as radiation for a fixed-focus laser diagnostic such as LIBS. This approach is able to determine optimum robot poses for arbitrary targets in 3D for arbitrary diagnostic mounting with respect to the robot. The approach is able to avoid obstacles and avoid occlusion of the target by said obstacles. This can be used as part of autonomous investigation and characterisation performed by mobile robots in hazardous environments.

AB  - This paper presents a feature encoding method of complex 3D objects for high-level semantic features. Recent approaches to object recognition methods become important for semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there is a lack of consideration of the probabilistic observation model for 3D objects, as the shape of a 3D object basically follows a complex probability distribution. Furthermore, since the mobile robot equipped with a range sensor observes only a single view, much information of the object shape is discarded. These limitations are the major obstacles to semantic SLAM and view-independent loop closure using 3D object shapes as features. In order to enable the numerical analysis for the Bayesian inference, we approximate the true observation model of 3D objects to tractable distributions. Since the observation likelihood can be obtained from the generative model, we formulate the true generative model for 3D object with the Bayesian networks. To capture these complex distributions, we apply a variational auto-encoder. To analyze the approximated distributions and encoded features, we perform classification with maximum likelihood estimation and shape retrieval.

In this paper we present a novel model to generate this data and label augmentation using only one short range fisheye camera. We present our simulator and how it can be used as a consistent metric for lateral end-to-end control evaluation. Experiments are conducted on a custom dataset corresponding to more than 10000 km and 200 hours of open road driving. Finally we evaluate this model on real world driving scenarios, open road and a custom test track with challenging obstacle avoidance and sharp turns. In our simulator based on real-world videos, the final model was capable of more than 99% autonomy on urban road.

AB  - Nonlinear optimal control problems are challenging to solve efficiently due to non-convexity. This paper introduces a trajectory optimization approach that achieves realtime performance by combining machine learning to predict optimal trajectories with refinement by quadratic optimization. First, a library of optimal trajectories is calculated offline and used to train a neural network. Online, the neural network predicts a trajectory for a novel initial state and cost function, and this prediction is further optimized by a sparse quadratic programming solver. We apply this approach to a fly-to-target movement problem for an indoor quadrotor. Experiments demonstrate that the technique calculates near-optimal trajectories in a few milliseconds, and generates agile movement that can be tracked more accurately than existing methods.

AB  - Autonomous elevator operation is considered an intelligent solution in handling the inter-floor navigation problem of service robots. As one of the most fundamental steps, elevator button recognition starts to receive more and more attention. However, due to the challenging image conditions and severe class imbalance problem, the performance of existing results is unsatisfying. In this paper, we propose to combine an optical character recognition (OCR) network and the Faster RCNN architecture into a single neural network, called OCR-RCNN to facilitate an end-to-end training and elevator button recognition procedure. To verify our method, we collect a large dataset of elevator panels and carry out extensive comparative experiments. The experiment results show that our method can greatly outperform the traditional recognition pipelines, yielding an accurate and robust performance on recognizing untrained elevator buttons.

AB  - We focus on autonomously generating robot motion for day to day physical tasks that is expressive of a certain style or emotion. Because we seek generalization across task instances and task types, we propose to capture style via cost functions that the robot can use to augment its nominal task cost and task constraints in a trajectory optimization process. We compare two approaches to representing such cost functions: a weighted linear combination of hand-designed features, and a neural network parameterization operating on raw trajectory input. For each cost type, we learn weights for each style from user feedback. We contrast these approaches to a nominal motion across different tasks and for different styles in a user study, and find that they both perform on par with each other, and significantly outperform the baseline. Each approach has its advantages: featurized costs require learning fewer parameters and can perform better on some styles, but neural network representations do not require expert knowledge to design features and could even learn more complex, nuanced costs than an expert can easily design.

AB  - Self-driving vehicles are being increasingly deployed in the wild. One of the most important next hurdles for autonomous driving is how such vehicles will optimally interact with one another and with their surroundings. In this paper, we consider the lane changing problem that is fundamental to road-bound multi-vehicle systems, and approach it through a combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and game theory. We introduce a proactive-passive lane changing framework and formulate the lane changing problem as a Markov game between the proactive and passive vehicles. Based on different approaches to carry out DRL to solve the Markov game, we propose an asynchronous lane changing scheme as in a single-agent RL setting and a synchronous cooperative lane changing scheme that takes into consideration the adaptive behavior of the other vehicle in a vehicle's decision. Experimental results show that the synchronous scheme can effectively create and find proper merging moment after sufficient training. The framework and solution developed here demonstrate the potential of using reinforcement learning to solve multi-agent autonomous vehicle tasks such as the lane changing as they are formulated as Markov games.

AB  - This study proposes an imitation learning method based on force and position information. Force information is required for precise object manipulation but is difficult to obtain because the acting and reaction forces cannot be separated. To separate the forces, we proposed to introduce bilateral control, in which the acting and reaction forces are divided using two robots. In the proposed method, two models of neural networks learn a task; to draw a line along a ruler. We verify the possibility that force information is essential to imitate the human skill of object manipulation.

AB  - Sampling-based motion planners have experienced much success due to their ability to efficiently and evenly explore the state space. However, for many tasks, it may be more efficient to not uniformly explore the state space, especially when there is prior information about its structure. Previous methods have attempted to modify the sampling distribution using hand selected heuristics that can work well for specific environments but not universally. In this paper, a policy-search based method is presented as an adaptive way to learn implicit sampling distributions for different environments. It utilizes information from past searches in similar environments to generate better distributions in novel environments, thus reducing overall computational cost. Our method can be incorporated with a variety of sampling-based planners to improve performance. Our approach is validated on a number of tasks, including a 7DOF robot arm, showing marked improvement in number of collision checks as well as number of nodes expanded compared with baseline methods.

AB  - Accurate state estimation is a fundamental module for various intelligent applications, such as robot navigation, autonomous driving, virtual and augmented reality. Visual and inertial fusion is a popular technology for 6-DOF state estimation in recent years. Time instants at which different sensors' measurements are recorded are of crucial importance to the system's robustness and accuracy. In practice, timestamps of each sensor typically suffer from triggering and transmission delays, leading to temporal misalignment (time offsets) among different sensors. Such temporal offset dramatically influences the performance of sensor fusion. To this end, we propose an online approach for calibrating temporal offset between visual and inertial measurements. Our approach achieves temporal offset calibration by jointly optimizing time offset, camera and IMU states, as well as feature locations in a SLAM system. Furthermore, the approach is a general model, which can be easily employed in several feature-based optimization frameworks. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of our calibration approach even compared with other state-of-art offline tools. The VIO comparison against other methods proves that the online temporal calibration significantly benefits visual-inertial systems. The source code of temporal calibration is integrated into our public project, VINS-Mono1.

AB  - Sensor fusion is a fundamental process in robotic systems as it extends the perceptual range and increases robustness in real-world operations. Current multi-sensor deep learning based semantic segmentation approaches do not provide robustness to under-performing classes in one modality, or require a specific architecture with access to the full aligned multi-sensor training data. In this work, we analyze statistical fusion approaches for semantic segmentation that overcome these drawbacks while keeping a competitive performance. The studied approaches are modular by construction, allowing to have different training sets per modality and only a much smaller subset is needed to calibrate the statistical models. We evaluate a range of statistical fusion approaches and report their performance against state-of-the-art baselines on both realworld and simulated data. In our experiments, the approach improves performance in IoU over the best single modality segmentation results by up to 5%. We make all implementations and configurations publicly available.

AB  - A fundamental problem of non-linear state estimation in robotics is the violation of assumptions about the sensors' error distribution. State of the art approaches reduce the impact of these violations with robust cost functions or predefined non-Gaussian error models. Both require extensive parameter tuning and fail if the sensors' error characteristic changes over time, due to environmental changes, ageing or sensor malfunctions. We demonstrate how the error distribution itself can be part of the state estimation process. Based on an efficient approximation of a Gaussian mixture, we optimize the sensor model simultaneously during the standard state estimation. Due to an implicit expectation-maximization approach, we achieve a fast convergence without prior knowledge of the true distribution parameters. We implement this self-tuning algorithm in a least-squares optimization framework and demonstrate its real time capability on a real world dataset for satellite localization of a driving vehicle. The resulting estimation quality is superior to previous robust algorithms.

AB  - In this paper, we present the Trifo Visual Inertial Odometry (Trifo-VIO), a tightly-coupled filtering-based stereo VIO system using both points and lines. Line features help improve system robustness in challenging scenarios when point features cannot be reliably detected or tracked, e.g. low-texture environment or lighting change. In addition, we propose a novel lightweight filtering-based loop closing technique to reduce accumulated drift without global bundle adjustment or pose graph optimization. We formulate loop closure as EKF updates to optimally relocate the current sliding window maintained by the filter to past keyframes. We also present the Trifo Ironsides dataset, a new visual-inertial dataset, featuring high-quality synchronized stereo camera and IMU data from the Ironsides sensor [3] with various motion types and textures and millimeter-accuracy groundtruth. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we conduct extensive comparison with state-of-the-art approaches (OKVIS, VINS-MONO and S-MSCKF) using both the public EuRoC dataset and the Trifo Ironsides dataset.

AB  - The inherent scale ambiguity in monocular vision is a well known issue that forces the integration of other sensory sources to obtain metric references. However, 2D or 3D LiDARs and RGB-D sensors, while guaranteeing metrological accuracy, impose a non negligible burden both in terms of computational load and power requirements limiting the feasibility of being implemented on small exploration vehicles. This paper presents a scale aware monocular Visual Odometry framework that fuses range data from a laser altimeter in order to recover and maintain a correct metric scale. The proposed Visual Odometry method consists of a keyframe based tracking and mapping algorithm using optical flow where range data serves as a scale constraint on a keyframe to keyframe basis. An optimization backend based on iSAM2 is employed in order to refine the trajectory and map estimates eliminating the scale drift without the need of performing loop closures. We demonstrate that our algorithm can obtain very similar performances to state of the art stereo visual SLAM and RGB-D methods.

AB  - The here presented flying system uses two pairs of wide-angle stereo cameras and maps a large area of interest in a short amount of time. We present a multicopter system equipped with two pairs of wide-angle stereo cameras and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for robust visual-inertial navigation and time-efficient omni-directional 3D mapping. The four cameras cover a 240 degree stereo field of view (FOV) vertically, which makes the system also suitable for cramped and confined environments like caves. In our approach, we synthesize eight virtual pinhole cameras from four wide-angle cameras. Each of the resulting four synthesized pinhole stereo systems provides input to an independent visual odometry (VO). Subsequently, the four individual motion estimates are fused with data from an IMU, based on their consistency with the state estimation. We describe the configuration and image processing of the vision system as well as the sensor fusion and mapping pipeline on board the MAV. We demonstrate the robustness of our multi-VO approach for visual-inertial navigation and present results of a 3D-mapping experiment.

AB  - Indoor localization is critical to many location-aware applications, however, a low-cost solution with guaranteed accuracies has not yet come. Visible Light Communication (VLC-) based localization techniques are very promising to fill this gap. In this paper, we propose Plugo, a novel VLC system with random multiple access towards low-cost indoor localization. Compared to conventional RF-based approaches that rely on dedicated wireless access points as location beacons, the proposed system has the potential to deliver better accuracies with reduced cost. Specifically, we build a handful of compact VLC-compatible LED bulbs out of low-cost offthe-shelf components (around $10 total cost for each assembly) and recover VLC signals using a cheap photodiode receiver. The basic framed slotted Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area (ALOHA) is exploited to achieve random multiple access over the shared optical medium. We show its effectiveness in beacon broadcasting by experiments, and further, demonstrate a preliminary localization result with sound accuracy by using fingerprinting-based methods in a customized testbed.

AB  - In multi-robot systems, although the idea of behaviors allows for an efficient solution to low-level tasks, high-level missions can rarely be achieved by the execution of a single behavior. In contrast to this, a sequence of behaviors would provide the requisite expressiveness, but there are no a priori guarantees that the sequence is composable in the sense that the robots can actually execute it. In order to guarantee a provably correct composition of behaviors, Finite-Time Convergence Control Barrier Functions are introduced in this paper to guarantee the terminal configuration of one behavior is a valid initial configuration for the following one. Nominal control inputs prescribed by the behaviors are modified in a minimally invasive fashion, in order to establish the information-exchange network required by the following behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed composition strategy is validated on a team of mobile robots.

AB  - Unsupervised learning techniques, such as Bayesian topic models, are capable of discovering latent structure directly from raw data. These unsupervised models can endow robots with the ability to learn from their observations without human supervision, and then use the learned models for tasks such as autonomous exploration, adaptive sampling, or surveillance. This paper extends single-robot topic models to the domain of multiple robots. The main difficulty of this extension lies in achieving and maintaining global consensus among the unsupervised models learned locally by each robot. This is especially challenging for multi-robot teams operating in communication-constrained environments, such as marine robots. We present a novel approach for multi-robot distributed learning in which each robot maintains a local topic model to categorize its observations and model parameters are shared to achieve global consensus. We apply a combinatorial optimization procedure that combines local robot topic distributions into a globally consistent model based on topic similarity, which we find mitigates topic drift when compared to a baseline approach that matches topics naÃ¯vely, We evaluate our methods experimentally by demonstrating multi-robot underwater terrain characterization using simulated missions on real seabed imagery. Our proposed method achieves similar model quality under bandwidth-constraints to that achieved by models that continuously communicate, despite requiring less than one percent of the data transmission needed for continuous communication.

AB  - In multi-robot systems passive interconnections among agents are often exploited to achieve a desired and robustly stable cooperative behavior. Nevertheless, the passivity constraint limits the kinds of behaviors that can be achieved. In this paper, we exploit the concept of energy tank for building a novel generalized interconnection that allows to impose any kind of dynamic coupling between two passive systems in a flexible way while preserving the passivity of the overall coupled system. The proposed strategy is validated by simulations and experiments.

AB  - Robots generate large amounts of data which need to be stored in a meaningful way such that they can be used and interpreted later. Such data can be written into log files, but these files lack the querying features and scaling capabilities of modern databases - especially when dealing with multi-robot systems, where the trade-off between availability and consistency has to be resolved. However, there is a plethora of existing databases, each with its own set of features, but none designed with robotic use cases in mind. This work presents three main contributions: (a) structures for benchmarking scenarios with a focus on networked multi-robot architectures, (b) an extensible workbench for benchmarking databases for different scenarios that makes use of Docker containers and (c) a comparison of existing databases given a set of multi-robot use cases to showcase the usage of the framework. The comparison gives indications for choosing an appropriate database.

AB  - Formation control strategies are fundamentally impacted by the sensing modalities present in the multi-robot team. Infinitesimal shape-similarity describes frameworks for which maintaining the relative angles between robots in formation also maintains the shape up to translation, rotation, and uniform scaling; however, ensuring invariance of the formation to these motions requires that the robots measure a sufficient number of angles, which means that the topology of the frame-work must be carefully designed. In this paper, we investigate the self-assembly of a class of infinitesimally shape-similar frameworks by robots equipped with bearing-only sensors. To accomplish self-assembly, we introduce a rank condition on the shape-similarity matrix for analyzing frameworks; we then use this rank condition to show that triangulations are infinitesimally shape-similar. A graph grammar is presented to assemble triangulations, and a controller is designed to achieve self-assembly of a team of differential-drive robots.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the problem of maintaining and restoring connectivity among a set of agents (humans or robots) by incrementally redeploying a team of mobile robots acting as communication relays. This problem is relevant in numerous scenarios where humans and robots are jointly deployed for tasks like urban search and rescue, surveillance, and the like. In this case, as the humans move in the environment, connectivity may be broken, and consequently, robots need to reposition themselves to restore it. We study the computational complexity of the problem, also in terms of approximation hardness, and present an Integer Linear Programming formulation to compute optimal solutions. We then analyze the performance of the proposed resolution approach against a heuristic algorithm taken from the literature, and we demonstrate how our method favorably compares in terms of solution quality and scalability.

This is a coupled problem that involves computation of a guard set for the environment and route planning for a heterogeneous group of robots through the points in the guard set. A terrain path that needs to be monitored can be transformed to generate a 1.5D terrain and robot paths can be modeled as chain visible curves to the terrain to ensure visibility. To efficiently monitor this 1.5D terrain, we present two solutions - a dynamic programming approach that finds the optimal solution but is slower and a integer linear programming solution that is faster in practice and that can take more constraints into account. We perform extensive simulations and do a comparative analysis of the two solution techniques.

AB  - In this paper, we present algorithms for synthesizing controllers to distribute a swarm of homogeneous robots (agents) over heterogeneous tasks which are operated in parallel. Swarm is modeled as a homogeneous collection of irreducible Markov chains. States of the Markov chain represent the tasks performed by the swarm. The target state is a pre-defined distribution of agents over the states of the Markov chain (and thus the tasks). We make use of ergodicity property of irreducible Markov chains to ensure that as an individual agent converges to the desired behavior in time, the swarm converges to the target state. To circumvent the problems faced by a global controller and local/decentralized controllers alone, we design a controller by combining global supervision with local-feedback-based state level decisions. Some numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

As well as adding the acceleration of the center of mass to the TO cost in order to smooth out the motion of the robot during trajectories with support polygons that do not intersect. By implementing this versatile TO algorithm on a multi-modal robotic platform we showed that many different forms of stable locomotion and manipulation were possible including a dynamic 0.7 m/s trot gait.

AB  - The factor graph framework is a convenient modeling technique for robotic state estimation where states are represented as nodes, and measurements are modeled as factors. When designing a sensor fusion framework for legged robots, one often has access to visual, inertial, joint encoder, and contact sensors. While visual-inertial odometry has been studied extensively in this framework, the addition of a preintegrated contact factor for legged robots has been only recently proposed. This allowed for integration of encoder and contact measurements into existing factor graphs, however, new nodes had to be added to the graph every time contact was made or broken. In this work, to cope with the problem of switching contact frames, we propose a hybrid contact preintegration theory that allows contact information to be integrated through an arbitrary number of contact switches. The proposed hybrid modeling approach reduces the number of required variables in the nonlinear optimization problem by only requiring new states to be added alongside camera or selected keyframes. This method is evaluated using real experimental data collected from a Cassie-series robot where the trajectory of the robot produced by a motion capture system is used as a proxy for ground truth. The evaluation shows that inclusion of the proposed preintegrated hybrid contact factor alongside visual-inertial navigation systems improves estimation accuracy as well as robustness to vision failure, while its generalization makes it more accessible for legged platforms.

AB  - This paper presents a complete motion planning approach for quadruped locomotion across an unknown terrain using a framework based on mixed-integer convex optimization and visual feedback. Vision data is used to find convex polygons in the surrounding environment, which acts as potentially feasible foothold regions. Then, a goal position is initially provided, which the best feasible destination planner uses to solve for an actual feasible goal position based on the extracted polygons. Next, a footstep planner uses the feasible goal position to plan a fixed number of footsteps, which may or may not result in the robot reaching the position. The center of mass (COM) trajectory planner using quadratic programming is extended to solve for a trajectory in 3D space while maintaining convexity, which reduces the computation time, allowing the robot to plan and execute motions online. The suggested method is implemented as a policy rather than a path planner, but its performance as a path planner is also shown. The approach is verified on both simulation and on a physical robot, ALPHRED, walking on various unknown terrains.

With this new design tool, the leg configuration of a new multi-modal platform BOBCAT is examined and refined.

AB  - The hardware compatibility of legged locomotion is often illustrated by Zero Moment Point (ZMP) that has been extensively studied for decades. One of the most popular models for computing the ZMP is the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model that expresses ZMP as a linear function of the center of mass(COM) and its acceleration. In the real world, however, it may not accurately predict the true ZMP of hardware due to various reasons such as unmodeled dynamics and differences between simulation model and hardware. In this paper, we aim to improve the theoretical ZMP model by learning the real hardware dynamics from experimental data. We first optimize the motion plan using the theoretical ZMP model and collect COP data by executing the motion on a force plate. We then train a new ZMP model that maps the motion plan variable to the actual ZMP and use the learned model for finding a new hardware-compatible motion plan. Through various locomotion tasks of a quadruped, we demonstrate that motions planned for the learned ZMP model are compatible on hardware when those for the theoretical ZMP model are not. Furthermore, experiments using ZMP models with different complexities reveal that overly complex models may suffer from over-fitting even though they can potentially represent more complex, unmodeled dynamics.

AB  - Dynamic walking robots have the potential for efficient and lifelike locomotion, but computing efficient gaits and tracking them is difficult in the presence of under-modeling. Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is a method to learn the control signal to track a periodic reference over several attempts, augmenting a model with online data. Terminal ILC (TILC), a variant of ILC, allows other performance objectives to be addressed at the cost of ignoring parts of the reference. However, dynamic walking robot gaits are not necessarily periodic in time. In this paper, we adapt TILC to jointly optimize final foot placement and energy efficiency on dynamic walking robots by indexing by a phase variable instead of time, yielding âphase-indexed TILCâ (Î¸ - TILC). When implemented on a five-link walker in simulation, Î¸- TILC learns a more energy-efficient walking motion compared to traditional time-indexed TILC.

AB  - This paper presents the design and validation of controlling hopping on the 3D bipedal robot Cassie. A spring-mass model is identified from the kinematics and compliance of the robot. The spring stiffness and damping are encapsulated by the leg length, thus actuating the leg length can create and control hopping behaviors. Trajectory optimization via direct collocation is performed on the spring-mass model to plan jumping and landing motions. The leg length trajectories are utilized as desired outputs to synthesize a control Lyapunov function based quadratic program (CLF-QP). Centroidal angular momentum, taking as an addition output in the CLF-QP, is also stabilized in the jumping phase to prevent whole body rotation in the underactuated flight phase. The solution to the CLF-QP is a nonlinear feedback control law that achieves dynamic jumping behaviors on bipedal robots with compliance. The framework presented in this paper is verified experimentally on the bipedal robot Cassie.

AB  - This paper first presents a formula to predict the largest balance disturbance from which a legged robot can recover without taking a step. It then presents an actuator design criterion derived from this formula that maximizes the robot's ability to recover. In this study, it is assumed that the robot is using a single major joint (e.g, a hip joint) to perform its balance recovery movement, and that the actuator consists of an electric motor and reduction gear. It is also assumed that the robot's support polygon is sufficiently small that it can be approximated as a point, and that the balance recovery motion is essentially planar, so that a 2-D analysis remains valid in 3-D. Finally, it is assumed that, for the purpose of studying balance recovery motion, the robot can be approximated by a reaction wheel pendulum. The theory has been tested experimentally on a robot designed to be good at balancing, and was found to agree closely with experimental results.

AB  - During percutaneous interventions in the brain, puncturing a vessel can cause life threatening complications. To avoid such a risk, current research has been directed towards the development of steerable needles. However, there is a risk that vessels of a size which is close to or smaller than the resolution of commonly used preoperative imaging modalities (0.59 Ã 0.59 Ã 1 mm) would not be detected during procedure planning, with a consequent increase in risk to the patient. In this work, we present a novel ensemble of forward looking sensors based on laser Doppler flowmetry, which are embedded within a biologically inspired steerable needle to enable vessel detection during the insertion process. Four Doppler signals are used to classify the pose of a vessel in front of the advancing needle with a high degree of accuracy (2Â° and 0.1 mm RMS errors), where relative measurements between sensors are used to correct for ambiguity. By using a robotic assisted needle insertion process, and thus a precisely controlled insertion speed, we also demonstrate how the setup can be used to discriminate between tissue bulk motion and vessel motion. In doing so, we describe a sensing apparatus applicable to a variety of needle steering systems, with the potential to eliminate the risk of hemorrhage during percutaneous procedures.

AB  - Emerging robot-assisted endovascular intervention has the potential to reduce X-ray radiations to the operator while enhancing the stability and dexterity of catheter manipulation. Supervised and shared autonomy of endovascular procedures could add further improvements in reduced fatigue and cognitive workloads of the operator, higher success rates of cannulation and improved surgical outcomes. However, robotic path planning for endovascular procedure is challenging due to complex and non-linear flow dynamics inside the vasculature. This paper presents a learning-based robotic catheterization platform addressing those challenges, this approach incorporates path integral reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on dynamic movement primitives (DMP) to enhance catheterization tasks by a customized robotic manipulator. The robotic trajectories were optimized through RL in order to avoid unwanted contacts between the catheter tip and the vessel wall. The proposed methods can adapt to different flow simulations, vascular models, and catheterization tasks. The quality of the catheterization was evaluated with performance metrics. The results show significant refinement of catheter paths by the proposed approach, resulting in shorter overall lengths and fewer contact forces, which can potentially reduce risks in endothelial wall damages, embolization, and stroke. The results support the development of robotic path planning for endovascular procedures as well as designing intelligent, hands-on robotic navigation platforms.

AB  - Minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery is a very challenging procedure that requires the manipulation of instruments in limited intraarticular space using distorted and sometimes uninformative images. Localizing the arthroscope reliably and at all times w.r.t. surrounding tissue is of fundamental importance to prevent unintended injury to patients. However, even highly-trained surgeons can struggle to localize the arthro-scope using poor image feedback. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate for the first time a visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, termed ArthroSLAM, capable of robustly and reliably localizing an arthroscope inside a human knee joint. The proposed system fuses the information obtained from the arthroscope, an external camera mounted on an arthroscope holder, and the odometry of a robotic arm manipulating the scope, in an Extended Kalman Filter framework. Also for the first time, we implement five alternative strategies for localization and compare them to our method in a realistic setup with a human cadaver knee joint. ArthroSLAM is shown to outperform the alternative strategies under various challenging conditions, localizing reliably and at all times with a mean Relative Pose Error of up to 1.4mm and 0.7Â°. Additional experiments conducted with degraded odometry data also validate the robustness of the method. An initial evaluation of the sparse map of a knee section computed by our method exhibits good morphological agreement. All results suggest that ArthroSLAM is a viable component for the robotic orthopedic surgical assistant of the future.

AB  - This paper explores the estimation of user attention in the setting of a cooperative handheld robot - a robot designed to behave as a handheld tool but that has levels of task knowledge. We use a tool-mounted gaze tracking system, which, after modelling via a pilot study, we use as a proxy for estimating the attention of the user. This information is then used for cooperation with users in a task of selecting and engaging with objects on a dynamic screen. Via a video game setup, we test various degrees of robot autonomy from fully autonomous, where the robot knows what it has to do and acts, to no autonomy where the user is in full control of the task. Our results measure performance and subjective metrics and show how the attention model benefits the interaction and preference of users.

AB  - Effective human-robot collaboration in shared control requires reasoning about the intentions of the human user. In this work, we present a mathematical formulation for human intent recognition during assistive teleoperation under shared autonomy. Our recursive Bayesian filtering approach models and fuses multiple non-verbal observations to probabilistically reason about the intended goal of the user. In addition to contextual observations, we model and incorporate the human agent's behavior as goal-directed actions with adjustable rationality to inform the underlying intent. We examine human inference on robot motion and furthermore validate our approach with a human subjects study that evaluates autonomy intent inference performance under a variety of goal scenarios and tasks, by novice subjects. Results show that our approach outperforms existing solutions and demonstrates that the probabilistic fusion of multiple observations improves intent inference and performance for shared-control operation.

We develop some principles for performance improvement in such systems based on the parallelization of inference and robot motion. The proposed principles are used to design a novel shared position control to navigate a circular massless holonomic robot in a known environment. The system is implemented in simulation and integrated with a real robotic wheelchair. Robot experiments demonstrated the viability of the proposed navigation method in various modes of operation.

AB  - We propose a novel approach to establish the relative pose of a mobile robot with respect to an operator that wants to interact with it; we focus on scenarios in which the robot is in the same environment as the operator, and is visible to them. The approach is based on comparing the trajectory of the robot, which is known in the robot's odometry frame, to the motion of the arm of the operator, who, for a short time, keeps pointing at the robot they want to interact with. In multi-robot scenarios, the same approach can be used to simultaneously identify which robot the operator wants to interact with. The main advantage over alternatives is that our system only relies on the robot's odometry, on a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU), and, crucially, on the operator's own perception. We experimentally show the feasibility of our approach using real-world robots.

AB  - In order to effectively interact with or supervise a robot, humans need to have an accurate mental model of its capabilities and how it acts. Learned neural network policies make that particularly challenging. We propose an approach for helping end-users build a mental model of such policies. Our key observation is that for most tasks, the essence of the policy is captured in a few critical states: states in which it is very important to take a certain action. Our user studies show that if the robot shows a human what its understanding of the task's critical states is, then the human can make a more informed decision about whether to deploy the policy, and if she does deploy it, when she needs to take control from it at execution time.

AB  - Hand gestures are a natural component of human-human communication. Simple hand gestures are intuitive and can exhibit great lexical variety. It stands to reason that such a user input mechanism can have many benefits, including seamless interaction, intuitive control and robustness to physical constraints and ambient electrical, light and sound interference. However, while semantic and logical information encoded via hand gestures is readily decoded by humans, leveraging this communication channel in human-machine interfaces remains a challenge. Recent data-driven deep learning approaches are promising towards uncovering abstract and complex relationships that manual and direct rule-based classification schemes fail to discover. Such an approach is amenable towards hand gesture recognition, but requires myriad data which can be collected physically via user experiments. This process, however, is onerous and tedious. A streamlined approach with less overhead is sought. To that end, this work presents a novel method of synthetic hand gesture dataset generation that leverages modern gaming engines. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that the dataset, despite being synthetic and requiring no physical data collection, is both accurate and rich enough to train a real-world hand gesture classifier that operates in real-time.

AB  - In this paper an interaction system based on a three dimensional virtual head projected onto a pyramidal display is proposed. The proposed system makes use of a social robot behavioral architecture already developed in our lab, which allows us to interchange developments between our robotic realizations and the 3D avatar. The overall system is divided into two parts: back projection subsystem and expression generator subsystem. The back projection subsystem projects a three-dimensional avatar onto a pyramidal structure in order to achieve a sensation of depth and realism. The expression generator subsystem carries out the avatar animations using shape keys and bones, following the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The system consists in several nodes that are integrated in ROS middleware (Robotic Operating System), and includes a user interface that makes the avatar teleoperation easier (the package is avaible in github public respository). In order to evaluate the expressiveness of the system, two sets of experiments have been performed: one to analyze the avatar's gestural ability, that is, its capability to perform expressions that can be identified by an observer, and a second experiment to measure the emotion displaying ability in terms of valence and arousal.

AB  - Estimating motion from images is a well-studied problem in computer vision and robotics. Previous work has developed techniques to estimate the motion of a moving camera in a largely static environment (e.g., visual odometry) and to segment or track motions in a dynamic scene using known camera motions (e.g., multiple object tracking). It is more challenging to estimate the unknown motion of the camera and the dynamic scene simultaneously. Most previous work requires a priori object models (e.g., tracking-by-detection), motion constraints (e.g., planar motion), or fails to estimate the full SE (3) motions of the scene (e.g., scene flow). While these approaches work well in specific application domains, they are not generalizable to unconstrained motions. This paper extends the traditional visual odometry (VO) pipeline to estimate the full SE (3) motion of both a stereo/RGB-D camera and the dynamic scene. This multimotion visual odometry (MVO) pipeline requires no a priori knowledge of the environment or the dynamic objects. Its performance is evaluated on a real-world dynamic dataset with ground truth for all motions from a motion capture system.

AB  - Bearing only cooperative localization has been used successfully on aerial and ground vehicles. In this paper we present an extension of the approach to the underwater domain. The focus is on adapting the technique to handle the challenging visibility conditions underwater. Furthermore, data from inertial, magnetic, and depth sensors are utilized to improve the robustness of the estimation. In addition to robotic applications, the presented technique can be used for cave mapping and for marine archeology surveying, both by human divers. Experimental results from different environments, including a fresh water, low visibility, lake in South Carolina; a cavern in Florida; and coral reefs in Barbados during the day and during the night, validate the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed approach.

AB  - Visual odometry methods are increasingly being used to estimate a vehicle's ego-motion from range data due to the decreasing cost of range sensors and the impressive speed and accuracy of visual odometry techniques. Dense geometry-based visual odometry methods are fundamentally based on the range flow constraint equation, an equation which depends on the temporal and spatial derivatives of range images. However, these derivatives are calculated with the fundamental assumption that the range flow is magnitude-limited. When scaling this method for faster vehicles, this assumption could be violated, invaliding the range flow constraint equation and thus corrupting the resulting ego-motion estimates. This paper derives the sensor, motion, environment, and sampling frequency conditions that would mathematically violate the range flow constraint. This information is useful for defining the operational limits of dense geometry-based visual odometry methods.

AB  - This work presents Semi-Supervised SLAM - a method for developing a map suitable for coarse localization within an underground environment with minimal human intervention, with system characteristics driven by real-world requirements of major mining companies. This work leverages existing information common within a mining environment - namely a surveyed mine map - which is used to sparsely ground map locations within the mine environment, increasing map accuracy and allowing localization within a global frame. Map creation utilizes a low cost camera sensor and minimal user information to produce a map which can be used for single camera localization within a mining environment. We evaluate the localization capabilities of the proposed approach in depth by performing data collection on operational underground mining vehicles within an active underground mine and by simulating occlusions common to the environment such as dust and water. The proposed system is capable of producing maps which have an average localization error 2.5 times smaller than the next best performing method ORB-SLAM2, comparable localization performance to a state-of-the-art deep learning approach (which is not a feasible solution due to both compute and training requirements) and is robust to simulated environmental obscurants.

AB  - Gas pipeline requires to be inspected regularly for leakages caused by natural disaster. Robots are widely used for pipeline inspection since they are more convenient than manual inspection. Several problems, however, exist due to the restriction by complex pipe networks. The most significant one is limited inspection range caused by restriction of cable length or wireless signal attenuation. In this paper, we proposed a concept of wireless relay communication to assist robot to extend the inspection range, and we newly developed a tracked robot chain system. In this system, each robot serves as a relay communication node. Leakage information of pipes are transmitted via these relay nodes. To ensure the stability of relay communication between adjacent robots, we adopted RSSI (received signal strength indication)-based evaluation method for cooperative and coordinated movement of robot chain system. Moreover, wireless application layer communication protocol (WALCP) was used to increase the stable performance of wireless relay communication. Each robot can self-navigate based on distance measurement module, which enables robots to pass through an elbow junction. Multiple experiments to evaluate relay transmission efficiency, RSSI-based cooperative movement, and comprehensive performance were conducted. Results revealed that our proposed system could realize relatively accurate relay transmission and RSSI-based coordinated movement.

AB  - This paper proposes an overall Multi-Controller Architecture (MCA) for safe and flexible navigation of autonomous navigation, under uncertainties in highway use-cases. In addition to the details given about the main modules (and their interactions) composing the proposed MCA, an important focus of the paper is made on the definition of a robust Two-Sequential Level Decision Network (TSLDN), which uses both: Extended Time-To-Collision (ETTC) metric and a new definition of a specific Predicted Inter-Distance Profile (PIDP, between vehicles during lane changes maneuvers) in order to estimate the maneuvers risks. The TSLDN is utilized for: the driving situation assessment, decision-making and for safety retrospection over the current maneuver risk. It allows us to have the best decision to achieve the vehicle navigation task while maximizing its safety. Several simulation results show the good performance of the overall proposed control architecture, mainly in terms of efficiency to handle probabilistic decision-making even for very risky scenarios.
