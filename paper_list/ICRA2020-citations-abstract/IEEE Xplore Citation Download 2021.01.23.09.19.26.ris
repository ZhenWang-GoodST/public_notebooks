AB  - Anchor boxes act as potential object localization candidates allow single-stage detectors to achieve real-time performance, at the cost of localization accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art two-stage detectors. Therefore, correct selection of the scale and aspect ratio associated with an anchor box is crucial for detector performance. In this work, we propose a novel architecture called DANet for improving the localization performance of single-stage object detectors, while maintaining real-time inference. The proposed network achieves this by predicting (1) the combination of aspect ratio and scale per feature map based on object density and (2) localization confidence per anchor box. We evaluate the proposed network using the benchmark dataset. On the MS COCO dataset, DANet achieves 30.9% AP at 51.8 fps using ResNet-18 and 45.3% AP at 7.4 fps using ResNeXt-101. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/PS06/AnchorNet.

AB  - This paper presents a self-supervised framework for learning to detect robust keypoints for odometry estimation and metric localisation in radar. By embedding a differentiable point-based motion estimator inside our architecture, we learn keypoint locations, scores and descriptors from localisation error alone. This approach avoids imposing any assumption on what makes a robust keypoint and crucially allows them to be optimised for our application. Furthermore the architecture is sensor agnostic and can be applied to most modalities. We run experiments on 280km of real world driving from the Oxford Radar RobotCar Dataset and improve on the state-of-the-art in point-based radar odometry, reducing errors by up to 45% whilst running an order of magnitude faster, simultaneously solving metric loop closures. Combining these outputs, we provide a framework capable of full mapping and localisation with radar in urban environments.

AB  - In this paper, we tackle the problem of relational behavior forecasting from sensor data. Towards this goal, we propose a novel spatially-aware graph neural network (SpAGNN) that models the interactions between agents in the scene. Specifically, we exploit a convolutional neural network to detect the actors and compute their initial states. A graph neural network then iteratively updates the actor states via a message passing process. Inspired by Gaussian belief propagation, we design the messages to be spatially-transformed parameters of the output distributions from neighboring agents. Our model is fully differentiable, thus enabling end-to-end training. Importantly, our probabilistic predictions can model uncertainty at the trajectory level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on two real-world self-driving datasets: ATG4D and nuScenes.

AB  - Object detection and motion parameters estimation are crucial tasks for self-driving vehicle safe navigation in a complex urban environment. In this work we propose a novel real-time approach of temporal context aggregation for motion detection and motion parameters estimation based on 3D point cloud sequence. We introduce an ego-motion compensation layer to achieve real-time inference with performance comparable to a naive odometric transform of the original point cloud sequence. Not only is the proposed architecture capable of estimating the motion of common road participants like vehicles or pedestrians but also generalizes to other object categories which are not present in training data. We also conduct an in-deep analysis of different temporal context aggregation strategies such as recurrent cells and 3D convolutions. Finally, we provide comparison results of our state-of-the-art model with existing solutions on KITTI Scene Flow dataset.

AB  - Fast, non-linear trajectories have been shown to be more accurately visually measured, and hence predicted, when sampled spatially (that is when the target position changes) rather than temporally, i.e. at a fixed-rate as in traditional frame-based cameras. Event-cameras, with their asynchronous, low latency information stream, allow for spatial sampling with very high temporal resolution, improving the quality of the data and the accuracy of post-processing operations. This paper investigates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with event-cameras spatial sampling for trajectory prediction. We show the benefit of using an Encoder-Decoder architecture over parameterised models for regression on event-based human-to-robot handover trajectories. In particular, we exploit the temporal information associated to the events stream to predict not only the incoming spatial trajectory points, but also when these will occur in time. After having studied the proper LSTM input/output sequence length, the network performance are compared to other regression models. Then, prediction behavior and computational time are analysed for the proposed method. We carry out the experiment using an iCub robot equipped with event-cameras, addressing the problem from the robot perspective.

AB  - Painting textures on 3D surfaces requires an understanding of the surface geometry, paint flow and paint mixing. This work formulates automated painting as a planning problem and proposes a solution based on a self-supervised learning framework that enables a robot to paint monochromatic non-uniform textures on 3D surfaces. We developed a method that iteratively decides the actions to take based on constant feedback of the painting process. Inspired by recent results, we formulate our solution using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to decide where and what to paint on the surface at each time instant. Specifically, the paint delivery tool's flow rate, orientation and position relative to the surface at each time instant are evaluated. This data can then be processed by a robot's planner of choice for generating a painting mission that can achieve the desired end result. We evaluate the proposed approach by providing qualitative and quantitative results of the different components. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the approach for the application by providing renderings from a paint simulation environment and show how a robot executes the planned painting mission on a generic 3D surface.

AB  - Sampling-based motion planning techniques have emerged as an efficient algorithmic paradigm for solving complex motion planning problems. These approaches use a set of probing samples to construct an implicit graph representation of the robot's state space, allowing arbitrarily accurate representations as the number of samples increases to infinity. In practice, however, solution trajectories only rely on a few critical states, often defined by structure in the state space (e.g., doorways). In this work we propose a general method to identify these critical states via graph-theoretic techniques (betweenness centrality) and learn to predict criticality from only local environment features. These states are then leveraged more heavily via global connections within a hierarchical graph, termed Critical Probabilistic Roadmaps. Critical PRMs are demonstrated to achieve up to three orders of magnitude improvement over uniform sampling, while preserving the guarantees and complexity of sampling-based motion planning.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the path planning problem on a graph. To reduce computation load by efficiently exploring the graph, we model the heuristic function as a neural network, which is trained by a training set derived from optimal paths to estimate the optimal cost between a pair of vertices on the graph. As such heuristic function cannot be proved to be an admissible heuristic to guarantee the global optimality of the path, we adapt an admissible heuristic function for the terminating criteria. Thus, proposed Learning Heuristic A* (LHA*) guarantees the bounded suboptimality of the path. The performance of LHA* was demonstrated by simulations in a maze-like map and compared with the performance of weighted A* with the same suboptimality bound.

AB  - Motion planning is important in a wide variety of applications such as robotic manipulation. However, it is still challenging to reliably find a collision-free path within a reasonable time. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework which combines a sampling-based planner and deep learning for faster motion planning, focusing on heuristics. The proposed method extends Task-Space Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (TS-RRT) to guide the trees with a "heuristic map" where every voxel has a cost-to-go value toward the goal. It also utilizes fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for producing more appropriate heuristic maps, rather than manually-designed heuristics. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments for motion planning using a real environment and mobile manipulator are carried out. The results indicate that it outperforms the existing planners, especially in terms of the average planning time with smaller variance.

AB  - We would like to enable a robotic agent to quickly and intelligently find promising trajectories through structured, unknown environments. Many approaches to navigation in unknown environments are limited to considering geometric information only, which leads to myopic behavior. In this work, we show that learning a sampling distribution that incorporates both geometric information and explicit, object-level semantics for sampling-based planners enables efficient planning at longer horizons in partially-known environments. We demonstrate that our learned planner is up to 2.7 times more likely to find a plan than the baseline, and can result in up to a 16% reduction in traversal costs as calculated by linear regression. We also show promising qualitative results on real-world data.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that predicts the feasibility of a mixed-integer program from visual input for robot manipulation planning. Integrating learning into task and motion planning is challenging, since it is unclear how the scene and goals can be encoded as input to the learning algorithm in a way that enables to generalize over a variety of tasks in environments with changing numbers of objects and goals. To achieve this, we propose to encode the scene and the target object directly in the image space.Our experiments show that our proposed network generalizes to scenes with multiple objects, although during training only two objects are present at the same time. By using the learned network as a heuristic to guide the search over the discrete variables of the mixed-integer program, the number of optimization problems that have to be solved to find a feasible solution or to detect infeasibility can greatly be reduced.

AB  - Exploration and collision-free navigation through an unknown environment is a fundamental task for autonomous robots. In this paper, a novel exploration strategy for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is presented. The goal of the exploration strategy is the reduction of map entropy regarding occupancy probabilities, which is reflected in a utility function to be maximised. We achieve fast and efficient exploration performance with tight integration between our octree-based occupancy mapping approach, frontier extraction, and motion planning-as a hybrid between frontier-based and sampling-based exploration methods. The computationally expensive frontier clustering employed in classic frontier-based exploration is avoided by exploiting the implicit grouping of frontier voxels in the underlying octree map representation. Candidate next-views are sampled from the map frontiers and are evaluated using a utility function combining map entropy and travel time, where the former is computed efficiently using sparse raycasting. These optimisations along with the targeted exploration of frontier-based methods result in a fast and computationally efficient exploration planner. The proposed method is evaluated using both simulated and real-world experiments, demonstrating clear advantages over state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - Autonomous landing on a moving platform presents unique challenges for multirotor vehicles, including the need to accurately localize the platform, fast trajectory planning, and precise/robust control. Previous works studied this problem but most lack explicit consideration of the wind disturbance, which typically leads to slow descents onto the platform. This work presents a fully autonomous vision-based system that addresses these limitations by tightly coupling the localization, planning, and control, thereby enabling fast and accurate landing on a moving platform. The platform's position, orientation, and velocity are estimated by an extended Kalman filter using simulated GPS measurements when the quadrotor-platform distance is large, and by a visual fiducial system when the platform is nearby. The landing trajectory is computed online using receding horizon control and is followed by a boundary layer sliding controller that provides tracking performance guarantees in the presence of unknown, but bounded, disturbances. To improve the performance, the characteristics of the turbulent conditions are accounted for in the controller. The landing trajectory is fast, direct, and does not require hovering over the platform, as is typical of most stateof-the-art approaches. Simulations and hardware experiments are presented to validate the robustness of the approach.

AB  - Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer significant performance advantages over rotary-wing UAVs in terms of speed, endurance, and efficiency. However, these vehicles have traditionally been severely limited with regards to maneuverability. In this paper, we present a nonlinear control approach for enabling aerobatic fixed-wing UAVs to maneuver in constrained spaces. Our approach utilizes full-state direct trajectory optimization and a minimalistic, but representative, nonlinear aircraft model to plan aggressive fixed-wing trajectories in real-time at 5 Hz across high angles-of-attack. Randomized motion planning is used to avoid local minima and local-linear feedback is used to compensate for model inaccuracies between updates. We demonstrate our method in hardware and show that both local-linear feedback and re-planning are necessary for successful navigation of a complex environment in the presence of model uncertainty.

The resulting Flight Envelope is expressed as a convex intersection of half-spaces. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is designed which takes into account the Flight Envelope constraints, to avoid Loss-of-Control. The overall system is shown to operate in real-time in a simulation environment.

AB  - This paper presents a novel vehicle motion forecasting method based on multi-head attention. It produces joint forecasts for all vehicles on a road scene as sequences of multi-modal probability density functions of their positions. Its architecture uses multi-head attention to account for interactions between all vehicles, and long short-term memory layers for encoding and forecasting. It relies solely on vehicle position tracks, does not need maneuver definitions, and does not rasterize the scene as a spatial grid. This allows it to be more versatile than similar model while combining many forecasting capabilities, namely joint forecast with interactions, uncertainty estimation, and multi-modality. The resulting prediction likelihood outperforms state-of-the-art models on the same dataset.

AB  - We present a novel framework for object-level 3D underwater reconstruction using imaging sonar sensors. We demonstrate that imaging sonar reconstruction is analogous to the problem of confocal non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reconstruction. Drawing upon this connection, we formulate the problem as one of solving for volumetric albedo, where the scene of interest is modeled as a directionless albedo field. After discretization, reconstruction reduces to a convex linear optimization problem, which we can augment with a variety of priors and regularization terms. We show how to solve the resulting regularized problems using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simulation and on real-world datasets collected in a controlled, test tank environment with several different sonar elevation apertures.

AB  - This work presents a semantic map management approach for various environments by triggering multiple maps with different simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) configurations. A modular map structure allows to add, modify or delete maps without influencing other maps of different areas. The hierarchy level of our algorithm is above the utilized SLAM method. Evaluating laser scan data (e.g. the detection of passing a doorway) triggers a new map, automatically choosing the appropriate SLAM configuration from a manually predefined list. Single independent maps are connected by link-points, which are located in an overlapping zone of both maps, enabling global navigation over several maps. Loop- closures between maps are detected by an appearance-based method, using feature matching and iterative closest point (ICP) registration between point clouds. Based on the arrangement of maps and link-points, a topological graph is extracted for navigation purpose and tracking the global robot's position over several maps. Our approach is evaluated by mapping a university campus with multiple indoor and outdoor areas and abstracting a metrical-topological graph. It is compared to a single map running with different SLAM configurations. Our approach enhances the overall map quality compared to the single map approaches by automatically choosing predefined SLAM configurations for different environmental setups.

AB  - Performing collaborative semantic mapping is a critical challenge for cooperative robots to maintain a comprehensive contextual understanding of the surroundings. Most of the existing work either focus on single robot semantic mapping or collaborative geometry mapping. In this paper, a novel hierarchical collaborative probabilistic semantic mapping framework is proposed, where the problem is formulated in a distributed setting. The key novelty of this work is the mathematical modeling of the overall collaborative semantic mapping problem and the derivation of its probability decomposition. In the single robot level, the semantic point cloud is obtained based on heterogeneous sensor fusion model and is used to generate local semantic maps. Since the voxel correspondence is unknown in collaborative robots level, an Expectation-Maximization approach is proposed to estimate the hidden data association, where Bayesian rule is applied to perform semantic and occupancy probability update. The experimental results show the high quality global semantic map, demonstrating the accuracy and utility of 3D semantic map fusion algorithm in real missions.

We propose a new map representation, in which occupied and free space are separated by the decision boundary of a kernel perceptron classifier. We develop an online training algorithm that maintains a very sparse set of support vectors to represent obstacle boundaries in configuration space. We also derive conditions that allow complete (without sampling) collision-checking for piecewise-linear and piecewise-polynomial robot trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our mapping and collision checking algorithms for autonomous navigation of an Ackermann-drive robot in unknown environments.

AB  - Robots require a detailed understanding of the 3D structure of the environment for autonomous navigation and path planning. A popular approach is to represent the environment using metric, dense 3D maps such as 3D occupancy grids. However, in large environments the computational power required for most state-of-the-art 3D dense mapping systems is compromising precision and real-time capability. In this work, we propose a novel mapping method that is able to build and maintain 3D dense representations for large indoor environments using standard CPUs. Topological global representations and 3D dense submaps are maintained as hybrid global map. Submaps are generated for every new visited place. A place (room) is identified as an isolated part of the environment connected to other parts through transit areas (doors). This semantic partitioning of the environment allows for a more efficient mapping and path-planning. We also propose a method for autonomous exploration that directly builds the hybrid representation in real time.We validate the real-time performance of our hybrid system on simulated and real environments regarding mapping and path-planning. The improvement in execution time and memory requirements upholds the contribution of the proposed work.

AB  - Planar markers are useful in robotics and computer vision for mapping and localisation. Given a detected marker in an image, a frequent task is to estimate the 6DOF pose of the marker relative to the camera, which is an instance of planar pose estimation (PPE). Although there are mature techniques, PPE suffers from a fundamental ambiguity problem, in that there can be more than one plausible pose solutions for a PPE instance. Especially when localisation of the marker corners is noisy, it is often difficult to disambiguate the pose solutions based on reprojection error alone. Previous methods choose between the possible solutions using a heuristic criterion, or simply ignore ambiguous markers.We propose to resolve the ambiguities by examining the consistencies of a set of markers across multiple views. Our specific contributions include a novel rotation averaging formulation that incorporates long-range dependencies between possible marker orientation solutions that arise from PPE ambiguities. We analyse the combinatorial complexity of the problem, and develop a novel lifted algorithm to effectively resolve marker pose ambiguities, without discarding any marker observations. Results on real and synthetic data show that our method is able to handle highly ambiguous inputs, and provides more accurate and/or complete marker-based mapping and localisation.

AB  - A service robot is expected to provide proactive service for visitors who require its help. In contrast to passive service, e.g., providing service only after being spoken to, proactive service initiates an interaction at an early stage, e.g., talking to potential visitors who need the robot's help in advance. This paper addresses how to anticipate the start of user interaction. We propose an approach using only a single RGB camera that anticipates whether a visitor will come to the robot for interaction or just pass it by. In the proposed approach, we (i) utilize the visitor's pose information from captured images incorporating facial information, (ii) train a CNN-LSTM-based model in an end-to-end manner with an exponential loss for early anticipation, and (iii) during the training, the network branch for facial keypoints acquired as the part of the human pose information is taught to mimic the branch trained with the face image from a specialized face detector with a human verification. By virtue of (iii), at the inference, we can run our model in an embedded system processing only the pose information without an additional face detector and typical accuracy drop. We evaluated the proposed approach on our collected real world data with a real service robot and publicly available JPL interaction dataset and found that it achieved accurate anticipation performance.

AB  - In table tennis, the rotation (spin) of the ball plays a crucial role. A table tennis match will feature a variety of strokes. Each generates different amounts and types of spin. To develop a robot that can compete with a human player, the robot needs to detect spin, so it can plan an appropriate return stroke. In this paper we compare three methods to estimate spin. The first two approaches use a high-speed camera that captures the ball in flight at a frame rate of 380 Hz. This camera allows the movement of the circular brand logo printed on the ball to be seen. The first approach uses background difference to determine the position of the logo. In a second alternative, we train a CNN to predict the orientation of the logo. The third method evaluates the trajectory of the ball and derives the rotation from the effect of the Magnus force. This method gives the highest accuracy and is used for a demonstration. Our robot successfully copes with different spin types in a real table tennis rally against a human opponent.

AB  - A crucial ability of mobile intelligent agents is to integrate the evidence from multiple sensory inputs in an environment and to make a sequence of actions to reach their goals. In this paper, we attempt to approach the problem of Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation, the task of planning the shortest path from a random starting location in a scene to the sound source in an indoor environment, given only raw egocentric visual and audio sensory data. To accomplish this task, the agent is required to learn from various modalities, i.e., relating the audio signal to the visual environment. Here we describe an approach to audio-visual embodied navigation that takes advantage of both visual and audio pieces of evidence. Our solution is based on three key ideas: a visual perception mapper module that constructs its spatial memory of the environment, a sound perception module that infers the relative location of the sound source from the agent, and a dynamic path planner that plans a sequence of actions based on the audio-visual observations and the spatial memory of the environment to navigate toward the goal. Experimental results on a newly collected Visual-Audio-Room dataset using the simulated multi-modal environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several competitive baselines.

AB  - Autonomous tool construction is a significant but challenging task in robotics. This task can be interpreted as when given a reference tool, selecting some available candidate parts to reconstruct it. Most of the existing works perform tool construction in the form of action part and grasp part, which is only a specific construction pattern and limits its application to some extent. In general scenarios, a tool can be constructed in various patterns with different part pairs. Therefore, whether a part pair is most suitable for constructing the tool depends not only on itself, but on other parts in the same scene. To solve this problem, we construct a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) to model the relations between all part pairs, so that we can select the candidate parts in consideration of the global information. Afterwards, we embed the constructed GGNN into a RCNN-like structure to finally accomplish tool construction. The whole model will be named Tool Construction Graph RCNN (TC-GRCNN). In addition, we develop a mechanism that can generate large-scale training and testing data in simulation environments, by which we can save the time of data collection and annotation. Finally, the proposed model is deployed on the physical robot. The experiment results show that TC-GRCNN can perform well in the general scenarios of tool construction.

AB  - Correlation filter (CF) has recently exhibited promising performance in visual object tracking for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Such online learning method heavily depends on the quality of the training-set, yet complicated aerial scenarios like occlusion or out of view can reduce its reliability. In this work, a novel time slot-based distillation approach is proposed to efficiently and effectively optimize the training-set's quality on the fly. A cooperative energy minimization function is established to score the historical samples adaptively. To accelerate the scoring process, frames with high confident tracking results are employed as the keyframes to divide the tracking process into multiple time slots. After the establishment of a new slot, the weighted fusion of the previous samples generates one key-sample, in order to reduce the number of samples to be scored. Besides, when the current time slot exceeds the maximum frame number, which can be scored, the sample with the lowest score will be discarded. Consequently, the training-set can be efficiently and reliably distilled. Comprehensive tests on two well-known UAV benchmarks prove the effectiveness of our method with real-time speed on single CPU.

AB  - It is difficult for both cameras and depth sensors to obtain reliable information in hazy scenes. Therefore, image dehazing is still one of the most challenging problems to solve in computer vision and robotics. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), lots of dehazing and depth estimation algorithms using CNNs have emerged. However, very few of those try to solve these two problems at the same time. Focusing on the fact that traditional haze modeling contains depth information in its formula, we propose a CNN-based simultaneous dehazing and depth estimation network. Our network aims to estimate both a dehazed image and a fully scaled depth map from a single hazy RGB input with end-to-end training. The network contains a single dense encoder and four separate decoders; each of them shares the encoded image representation while performing individual tasks. We suggest a novel depth-transmission consistency loss in the training scheme to fully utilize the correlation between the depth information and transmission map. To demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithm, we performed various ablation studies and compared our results to those of state-of-the-art algorithms in dehazing and single image depth estimation, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we show the generality of our network by applying it to some real-world examples.

AB  - In this paper, an Internet of Things-based human-robot collaborative control scheme is developed in Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery scenario. A hierarchical operational space formulation is designed to exploit the redundancies of the 7-DoFs redundant manipulator to handle multiple operational tasks based on their priority levels, such as guaranteeing a remote center of motion constraint and avoiding collision with a swivel motion without influencing the undergoing surgical operation. Furthermore, the concept of the Internet of Robotic Things is exploited to facilitate the best action of the robot in human-robot interaction. Instead of utilizing compliant swivel motion, HTC VIVE PRO controllers, used as the Internet of Things technology, is adopted to detect the collision. A virtual force is applied to the robot elbow, enabling a smooth swivel motion for human-robot interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated using experiments performed on a patient phantom in a lab setup environment, with a KUKA LWR4+ slave robot and a SIGMA 7 master manipulator. By comparison with previous works, the results show improved performances in terms of the accuracy of the RCM constraint and surgical tip.

AB  - The control of passive dynamic systems remains a challenging problem in the field of robotics, and insights from their study can inform everything from dynamic behaviors on actuated robots to robotic assistive devices. In this work, we explore the use of flat actuated environments for realizing passive dynamic balancing and locomotion. Specifically, we utilize a novel omnidirectional actuated floor to dynamically stabilize two robotic systems. We begin with an inverted pendulum to demonstrate the ability to control a passive system through an active environment. We then consider a passive bipedal robot wherein dynamically stable periodic walking gaits are generated through an optimization that leverages the actuated floor. The end result is the ability to demonstrate passive dynamic walking experimentally through the use of actuated environments.

AB  - The variable-height inverted pendulum (VHIP) model enables a new balancing strategy by height variations of the center of mass, in addition to the well-known ankle strategy. We propose a biped stabilizer based on linear feedback of the VHIP that is simple to implement, coincides with the state-of-the-art for small perturbations and is able to recover from larger perturbations thanks to this new strategy. This solution is based on "best-effort" pole placement of a 4D divergent component of motion for the VHIP under input feasibility and state viability constraints. We complement it with a suitable whole-body admittance control law and test the resulting stabilizer on the HRP-4 humanoid robot.

AB  - Biped walking involves a series of transitions between single support (SS) and double support (DS) contact configurations that can include both balanced and unbalanced states. The new concept of steppability is introduced to partition the set of unbalanced states into steppable states and falling (unsteppable) states based on the ability of a biped system to respond to forward velocity perturbations by stepping. In this work, a complete system-specific analysis of the stepping process including full-order nonlinear system dynamics is presented for the DARwIn-OP humanoid robot and a human subject in the sagittal plane with respect to both balance stability and steppability. The balance stability and steppability of each system are analyzed by numerical construction of its balance stability boundaries (BSB) for the initial SS and final DS contact configuration and the steppable unbalanced state boundary (SUB). These results are presented with center of mass (COM) trajectories obtained from walking experiments to benchmark robot controller performance and analyze the variation of balance stability and steppability with COM and swing foot position along the progression of a step cycle. For each system, DS BSBs were obtained with both constrained and unconstrained arms in order to demonstrate the ability of this approach to incorporate the effects of angular momentum and system-specific characteristics such as actuation torque, velocity, and angle limits.

AB  - This paper presents a study that evaluates the effects on the walking pattern of a full-sized humanoid robot as it pushes different carts. Furthermore, it discuss a modified Zero Moment Point (ZMP) pattern based on a capture point method, and a friction compensation method for the arms. Humanoid researchers have demonstrated that robots can perform a wide range of tasks including handling tools, climbing ladders, and patrolling rough terrain. However, when it comes to handling objects while walking, humanoids are relatively limited; it becomes more apparent when humanoids have to push a cart. Many challenges become evident under such circumstances; for example, the walking pattern will be severely affected by the external force opposed by the cart. Therefore, an appropriate walking pattern dynamic model and arm compliance are needed to mitigate external forces. This becomes crucial in order to ensure the robot's self-balance and minimize external disturbances.

AB  - A compass-like biped robot can go down a gentle slope without the need of actuation through a proper choice of its dynamic parameter and starting from a suitable initial condition. Addition of control actions is requested to generate additional gaits and robustify the existing one. This paper designs an interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control, rooted within the port-Hamiltonian framework, to generate further gaits with respect to state-of-the-art methodologies, enlarge the basin of attraction of existing gaits, and further robustify the system against controller discretization and parametric uncertainties. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated through numerical simulations and comparison with existing passivity-based techniques.

AB  - This work deals with the problem of planning conflict-free paths for mobile robots in cluttered environments. Since centralized, coupled planning algorithms are computationally intractable for large numbers of robots, we consider decoupled planning, in which robots plan their paths sequentially in order of priority. Choosing how to prioritize the robots is a key consideration. State-of-the-art prioritization heuristics, however, do not model the coupling between a robot's mobility and its environment. This is particularly relevant when prioritizing between robots with different degrees of mobility. In this paper, we propose a prioritization rule that can be computed online by each robot independently, and that provides consistent, conflict-free path plans. Our innovation is to formalize a robot's path prospects to reach its goal from its current location. To this end, we consider the number of homology classes of trajectories, which capture distinct prospects of paths for each robot. This measure is used as a prioritization rule, whenever any robots enter negotiation to deconflict path plans. We perform simulations with heterogeneous robot teams and compare our method to five benchmarks. Our method achieves the highest success rate, and strikes a good balance between makespan and flowtime objectives.

AB  - This paper presents a method for predicting the probability of future connectivity between mobile robots with range-limited communication. In particular, we focus on its application to active motion planning for cooperative localization (CL). The probability of connection is modeled by the distribution of quadratic forms in random normal variables and is computed by the infinite power series expansion theorem. A finite-term approximation is made to realize the computational feasibility and three more modifications are designed to handle the adverse impacts introduced by the omission of the higher order series terms. On the basis of this algorithm, an active and CL problem with leader-follower architecture is then reformulated into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a one-step planning horizon, and the optimal motion strategy is generated by minimizing the expected cost of the MDP. Extensive simulations and comparisons are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of both the proposed prediction algorithm and the MDP model.

AB  - In many cases the multi-robot systems are desired to execute simultaneously multiple behaviors with different controllers, and sequences of behaviors in real time, which we call behavior mixing. Behavior mixing is accomplished when different subgroups of the overall robot team change their controllers to collectively achieve given tasks while maintaining connectivity within and across subgroups in one connected communication graph. In this paper, we present a provably minimum connectivity maintenance framework to ensure the subgroups and overall robot team stay connected at all times while providing the highest freedom for behavior mixing. In particular, we propose a real-time distributed Minimum Connectivity Constraint Spanning Tree (MCCST) algorithm to select the minimum inter-robot connectivity constraints preserving subgroup and global connectivity that are least likely to be violated by the original controllers. With the employed safety and connectivity barrier certificates for the activated connectivity constraints and collision avoidance, the behavior mixing controllers are thus minimally modified from the original controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach via simulations of up to 100 robots with multiple behaviors.

AB  - This paper considers the optimal cooperative robotic manipulation problem in terms of energy resources. In particular, we consider rigid cooperative manipulation systems, i.e., with rigid grasping contacts, and study energy-optimal conditions in the sense of minimization of the arising internal forces, which are inter-agent forces that do not contribute to object motion. Firstly, we use recent results to derive a closed form expression for the internal forces. Secondly, by using a standard inverse dynamics control protocol, we provide novel conditions on the force distribution to the robotic agents for provable internal force minimization. Moreover, we derive novel results on the provable achievement of a desired non-zero inter-agent internal force vector. Extensive simulation results in a realistic environment verify the theoretical analysis.

AB  - Unlike large and dangerous industrial robots at production lines in factories that are strictly fenced off, collaborative robots are smaller and safer and can be installed adjacent to human workers and collaborate with them. However, controlling and teaching new moves to collaborative robots can be difficult and time-consuming when using existing methods, such as pressing buttons on a teaching pendant and physically grabbing and moving the robot via direct teaching. We present Robot Telekinesis, a novel robot interaction technique that lets the user remotely control the movement of the end effector of a robot arm with unimanual and bimanual hand gestures that closely resemble handling a physical object. Through formal evaluation, we show that using a teaching pendant is slow and confusing and that direct teaching is fast and intuitive but physically demanding. Robot Telekinesis is as fast and intuitive as direct teaching without the need for physical contact or physical effort.

AB  - Executing multiple tasks concurrently is important in many robotic applications. Moreover, the prioritization of tasks is essential in applications where safety-critical tasks need to precede application-related objectives, in order to protect both the robot from its surroundings and vice versa. Furthermore, the possibility of switching the priority of tasks during their execution gives the robotic system the flexibility of changing its objectives over time. In this paper, we present an optimization-based task execution and prioritization framework that lends itself to the case of time-varying priorities as well as variable number of tasks. We introduce the concept of extended set-based tasks, encode them using control barrier functions, and execute them by means of a constrained-optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved in an online fashion. Finally, we show the application of the proposed approach to the case of a redundant robotic manipulator.

AB  - Human-robot interaction is one of the keys of assistive robots. Robots are expected to be compliant with people but at the same time correctly perform the tasks. In such applications, Cartesian impedance control is preferred over joint control, as the desired interaction and environmental feedback can be described more naturally, and the force to be exerted by the robot can be readily adjusted.This paper addresses the problem of controlling a robot arm in the operational space with variable stiffness so as to continuously adapt the force exerted in each phase of motion according to the precision requirements. Moreover, performing dimensionality reduction we can separate the degrees of freedom (DoF) relevant for the task from the redundant ones. The stiffness of the former can be adjusted constantly to achieve the required accuracy, while task-redundant DoF can be used to achieve other goals such as avoiding obstacles by moving in the directions where accuracy is not critical. The designed method is tested teaching the robot to give water to drink to a model of human head. Our empirical results demonstrate that the robot can learn precision requirements from demonstration. Furthermore, dimensionality reduction is proved to be useful to avoid obstacles.

AB  - Understanding of characteristics of objects such as fragility, rigidity, texture and dimensions facilitates and innovates robotic grasping. In this paper, we propose a context- aware anthropomorphic robotic hand (MagicHand) grasping system which is able to gather various information about its target object and generate grasping strategies based on the perceived information. In this work, NIR spectra of target objects are perceived to recognize materials on a molecular level and RGB-D images are collected to estimate dimensions of the objects. We selected six most used grasping poses and our system is able to decide the most suitable grasp strategies based on the characteristics of an object. Through multiple experiments, the performance of the MagicHand system is demonstrated.

AB  - In robotic grasping, objects are often occluded in ungraspable configurations such that no feasible grasp pose can be found, e.g. large flat boxes on the table that can only be grasped once lifted. Inspired by human bimanual manipulation, e.g. one hand to lift up things and the other to grasp, we address this type of problems by introducing pregrasp manipulation - push and lift actions. We propose a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning framework to train feedback control policies that utilize visual information and proprioceptive states of the robot to autonomously discover robust pregrasp manipulation. The robot arm learns to push the object first towards a support surface and then lift up one side of the object, creating an object-table clearance for possible grasping solutions. Furthermore, we show the robustness of the proposed learning framework in training pregrasp policies that can be directly transferred to a real robot. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the learned policy in real-world experiments, and demonstrate pregrasp manipulation of objects with various sizes, shapes, weights, and surface friction.

AB  - This paper introduces the technique of tilt-and-pivot manipulation, a new method for picking thin, rigid objects lying on a flat surface through robotic dexterous in-hand manipulation. During the manipulation process, the gripper is controlled to reorient about the contact with the object such that its finger can get in the space between the object and the supporting surface, which is formed by tilting up the object, with no relative sliding motion at the contact. As a result, a pinch grasp can be obtained on the faces of the thin object with ease. We discuss issues regarding the kinematics and planning of tilt-and-pivot, effector shape design, and the overall practicality of the manipulation technique, which is general enough to be applicable to any rigid convex polygonal objects. We also present a set of experiments in a range of bin picking scenarios.

AB  - The real-time segmentation of surgical instruments plays a crucial role in robot-assisted surgery. However, it is still a challenging task to implement deep learning models to do real-time segmentation for surgical instruments due to their high computational costs and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided lightweight network (LWANet), which can segment surgical instruments in real-time. LWANet adopts encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is the lightweight network MobileNetV2, and the decoder consists of depthwise separable convolution, attention fusion block, and transposed convolution. Depthwise separable convolution is used as the basic unit to construct the decoder, which can reduce the model size and computational costs. Attention fusion block captures global contexts and encodes semantic dependencies between channels to emphasize target regions, contributing to locating the surgical instrument. Transposed convolution is performed to upsample feature maps for acquiring refined edges. LWANet can segment surgical instruments in real-time while takes little computational costs. Based on 960x544 inputs, its inference speed can reach 39 fps with only 3.39 GFLOPs. Also, it has a small model size and the number of parameters is only 2.06 M. The proposed network is evaluated on two datasets. It achieves state-of-the- art performance 94.10% mean IOU on Cata7 and obtains a new record on EndoVis 2017 with a 4.10% increase on mean IOU.

AB  - Current challenges in automated robotic breast ultrasound (US) acquisitions include keeping acoustic coupling between the breast and the US probe, minimizing tissue deformations and safety. In this paper, we present how an autonomous 3D breast US acquisition can be performed utilizing a 7DOF robot equipped with a linear US transducer. Robotic 3D breast US acquisitions would increase the diagnostic value of the modality since they allow patient specific scans and have a high reproducibility, accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, 3D US acquisitions allow more flexibility in examining the breast and simplify registration with preoperative images like MRI. To overcome the current challenges, the robot follows a reference- based trajectory adjusted by a visual servoing algorithm. The reference trajectory is a patient specific trajectory coming from e.g. an MRI. The visual servoing algorithm commands in-plane rotations and corrects the probe contact based on confidence maps. A safety aware, intrinsically passive framework is utilised to actuate the robot. The approach is illustrated with experiments on a phantom, which show that the robot only needs minor pre-procedural information to consistently image the phantom while relying mainly on US feedback.

AB  - This paper presents a robust and accurate approach for the rigid registration of pre-operative and intraoperative point sets in image-guided surgery (IGS). Three challenges are identified in the pre-to-intraoperative registration: the intra-operative 3D data (usually forms a 3D curve in space) (1) is often contaminated with noise and outliers; (2) usually only covers a partial region of the whole pre-operative model; (3) is usually sparse. To tackle those challenges, we utilize the tangent vectors extracted from the sparse intraoperative data points and the normal vectors extracted from the pre-operative model points. Our first contribution is to formulate a novel probabilistic distribution of the error between a pair of corresponding tangent and normal vectors. The second contribution is, based on the novel distribution, we formulate the registration of two multi-dimensional (6D) point sets as a maximum likelihood (ML) problem and solve it under the expectation maximization (EM) framework. Our last contribution is, in order to facilitate the computation process, the derivatives of the objective function with respect to desired parameters are presented. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, in the context of anteriro cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, our method can achieve as low as 0.6795 mm mean target registration error (TRE) value with considerable noises and very limited overlapping ratios.

AB  - Surgical robots are used to perform minimally invasive surgery and alleviate much of the burden imposed on surgeons. Our group has developed a surgical robot to aid in the removal of tumors at the base of the skull via access through the nostrils. To avoid injuring the patients, a collision-avoidance algorithm that depends on having an accurate model for the poses of the instruments' shafts is used. Given that the model's parameters can change over time owing to interactions between instruments and other disturbances, the online estimation of the poses of the instrument's shaft is essential. In this work, we propose a new method to estimate the pose of the surgical instruments' shafts using a monocular endoscope. Our method is based on the use of an automatically annotated training dataset and an improved pose-estimation deep-learning architecture. In preliminary experiments, we show that our method can surpass state of the art vision-based marker-less pose estimation techniques (providing an error decrease of 55% in position estimation, 64% in pitch, and 69% in yaw) by using artificial images.

AB  - Accurate real-time catheter segmentation is an important pre-requisite for robot-assisted endovascular intervention. Most of the existing learning-based methods for catheter segmentation and tracking are only trained on smallscale datasets or synthetic data due to the difficulties of ground-truth annotation. Furthermore, the temporal continuity in intraoperative imaging sequences is not fully utilised. In this paper, we present FW-Net, an end-to-end and real-time deep learning framework for endovascular intervention. The proposed FW-Net has three modules: a segmentation network with encoder-decoder architecture, a flow network to extract optical flow information, and a novel flow-guided warping function to learn the frame-to-frame temporal continuity. We show that by effectively learning temporal continuity, the network can successfully segment and track the catheters in real-time sequences using only raw ground-truth for training. Detailed validation results confirm that our FW-Net outperforms stateof-the-art techniques while achieving real-time performance.

AB  - Robotic bronchoscopic intervention requires detailed 3D airway maps for both localisation and enhanced visualisation, especially at peripheral airways. Patient-specific airway maps can be generated from preoperative chest CT scans. Due to pathological abnormalities and anatomical variations, automatically delineating the airway tree with distal branches is a challenging task. In the paper, we propose a cascaded 2D+3D model that has been tailored for airway segmentation from pathological CT scans. A novel 2D neural network is developed to generate the initial predictions where the peripheral airways are refined by a 3D adversarial training model. A sampling strategy based on a sequence of morphological operations is employed for the concatenation of the 2D and 3D models. The method has been validated on 20 pathological CT scans with results demonstrating improved segmentation accuracy and consistency, especially in peripheral airways.

On the other hand, the strength of the plastic materials used in reasonably priced 3D printers and the accuracy of the printed parts are generally low. These problems affect the part-joining quality. Therefore, this paper describes a design method inspired by ancient Japanese wooden joinery techniques for assembling 3D-printed parts and presents the design of a robotic hand as its application. The joinery techniques use special shapes to assemble components and allow us to assemble the robotic hand without glue, screws or nails and to easily disassemble it.

AB  - We propose a gripper displacement-magnification mechanism and an extendable finger mechanism, both of which can be attached to a commercially available parallel gripper. We then verify the operation of the mechanism in order to expand applications of the parallel gripper. The displacement-magnification mechanism has a stacked rack-and-pinion system that doubles displacement. The extendable finger mechanism has two nails that extend and contract, reducing impact force and detecting changes in product height from expansion and contraction amounts. The parallel gripper has a width of 95 mm, a depth of 110 mm, and a height of 214 mm and weighs 1.36 kg. It has an open/close stroke of 60 mm, a gripping force of 7.4 N, and an opening/closing speed of 100 mm/s or more. Further, it was confirmed that the ends and inclinations of products can be reliably detected using the extending/contracting nail. The mechanism verification confirmed that our parallel gripper achieved the desired performance and is therefore useful.

AB  - Over the past few years, shape memory polymer (SMP) has been extensively studied in terms of its remarkable reversible dry adhesive properties and related smart adhesive applications. However, its exceptional properties have not been exploited for further opportunities such as pick-and-place applications, which would otherwise advance the robotic manipulation. This work explores the use of an SMP to design an adhesive gripper that picks and places a target solid object employing the reversible dry adhesion of an SMP. Compared with other single surface contact grippers including vacuum, electromagnetic, electroadhesion, and gecko grippers, the SMP adhesive gripper interacts with not only flat and smooth dry surfaces but also moderately rough and even wet surfaces for pick-and-place with high adhesion strength (> 2 atmospheres). In this work, associated physical mechanisms, SMP adhesive mechanics, and thermal conditions are studied. In particular, the numerical and experimental study elucidates that the optimal compositional and topological SMP design may substantially enhance its adhesion strength and reversibility, which leads to a strong grip force simultaneously with a minimized releasing force. Finally, the versatility and utility of the SMP adhesive gripper are highlighted through diverse pick-and-place demonstrations.

AB  - It is an effective strategy for the multi-person pose tracking task in videos to employ prediction and pose matching in a frame-by-frame manner. For this type of approach, uncertainty-aware modeling is essential because precise prediction is impossible. However, previous studies have relied on only a single prediction without incorporating uncertainty, which can cause critical tracking errors if the prediction is unreliable. This paper proposes an extension to this approach with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). This naturally reformulates the tracking scheme to handle multiple predictions (or hypotheses) of poses, thereby mitigating the negative effect of prediction errors. An important component of SMC, i.e., a proposal distribution, is designed as a probabilistic neural pose predictor, which can propose diverse and plausible hypotheses by incorporating epistemic uncertainty and heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty. In addition, a recurrent architecture is introduced to our neural modeling to utilize time-sequence information of poses to manage difficult situations, such as the frequent disappearance and reappearances of poses. Compared to existing baselines, the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art MOTA score on the PoseTrack2018 validation dataset by reducing approximately 50% of tracking errors from a state-of-the art baseline method.

AB  - Many high-level video understanding methods require input in the form of object proposals. Currently, such proposals are predominantly generated with the help of neural networks that were trained for detecting and segmenting a set of known object classes, which limits their applicability to cases where all objects of interest are represented in the training set. We propose an approach that can reliably extract spatio-temporal object proposals for both known and unknown object categories from stereo video. Our 4D Generic Video Tubes (4D-GVT) method combines motion cues, stereo data, and data-driven object instance segmentation in a probabilistic framework to compute a compact set of video-object proposals that precisely localizes object candidates and their contours in 3D space and time.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel method to simultaneously track the deformation of soft objects and estimate their elasticity parameters. The tracking of the deformable object is performed by combining the visual information captured by a RGB-D sensor with interactive Finite Element Method simulations of the object. The visual information is more particularly used to distort the simulated object. In parallel, the elasticity parameter estimation minimizes the error between the tracked object and a simulated object deformed by the forces that are measured using a force sensor. Once the elasticity parameters are estimated, our tracking algorithm can be used to estimate the deformation forces applied to an object without the use of a force sensor. We validated our method on several soft objects with different shape complexities. Our evaluations show the ability of our method to estimate the elasticity parameters as well as its use to estimate the forces applied to a deformable object without any force sensor. These results open novel perspectives to better track and control deformable objects during robotic manipulations.

AB  - Existing state-of-the-art object tracking can run into challenges when objects collide, occlude, or come close to one another. These visually based trackers may also fail to differentiate between objects with the same appearance but different materials. Existing methods may stop tracking or incorrectly start tracking another object. These failures are uneasy for trackers to recover from since they often use results from previous frames. By using audio of the impact sounds from object collisions, rolling, etc., our audio-visual object tracking (AVOT) neural network can reduce tracking error and drift. We train AVOT end to end and use audio-visual inputs over all frames. Our audio-based technique may be used in conjunction with other neural networks to augment visually based object detection and tracking methods. We evaluate its runtime frames-per-second (FPS) performance and intersection over union (IoU) performance against OpenCV object tracking implementations and a deep learning method. Our experiments, using the synthetic Sound-20K audio-visual dataset, demonstrate that AVOT outperforms single-modality deep learning methods, when there is audio from object collisions. A proposed scheduler network to switch between AVOT and other methods based on audio onset maximizes accuracy and performance over all frames in multimodal object tracking.

AB  - Pig counting is a crucial task for large-scale pig farming. Pigs are usually visually counted by human. But this process is very time-consuming and error-prone. Few studies in literature developed automated pig counting method. The existing works only focused on pig counting using single image, and its level of accuracy faced challenges due to pig movements, occlusion and overlapping. Especially, the field of view of a single image is very limited, and could not meet the needs of pig counting for large pig grouping houses. Towards addressing these challenges, we presented a real-time automated pig counting system in crowds using only one monocular fisheye camera with an inspection robot. Our system showed that it achieved performance superior to human. Our pipeline began with a novel bottom-up pig detection algorithm to avoid false negatives due to overlapping, occlusion and deformable pig shapes. This detection included a deep convolution neural network (CNN) for pig body part keypoints detection and the keypoints association method to identify individual pigs. It then employed an efficient on-line tracking method to associate pigs across image frames. Finally, pig counts were estimated by a novel spatial-aware temporal response filtering (STRF) method to suppress false positives caused by pig or camera movements or tracking failures. The whole pipeline has been deployed in an edge computing device, and demonstrated the effectiveness.

AB  - We present 6-PACK, a deep learning approach to category-level 6D object pose tracking on RGB-D data. Our method tracks in real time novel object instances of known object categories such as bowls, laptops, and mugs. 6-PACK learns to compactly represent an object by a handful of 3D keypoints, based on which the interframe motion of an object instance can be estimated through keypoint matching. These keypoints are learned end-to-end without manual supervision in order to be most effective for tracking. Our experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing methods on the NOCS category-level 6D pose estimation benchmark and supports a physical robot to perform simple vision-based closed-loop manipulation tasks.

AB  - Soft active materials can generate flexible locomotion and change configurations through large deformations when subjected to an external environmental stimulus. They can be engineered to design 'soft machines' such as soft robots, compliant actuators, flexible electronics, or bionic medical devices. By embedding ferromagnetic particles into soft elastomer matrix, the ferromagnetic soft matter can generate flexible movement and shift morphology in response to the external magnetic field. By taking advantage of this physical property, soft active structures undergoing desired motions can be generated by tailoring the layouts of the ferromagnetic soft elastomers. Structural topology optimization has emerged as an attractive tool to achieve innovative structures by optimizing the material layout within a design domain, and it can be utilized to architect ferromagnetic soft active structures. In this paper, the level-set-based topology optimization method is employed to design ferromagnetic soft robots (FerroSoRo). The objective function comprises a sub-objective function for the kinematics requirement and a sub-objective function for minimum compliance. Shape sensitivity analysis is derived using the material time derivative and adjoint variable method. Three examples, including a gripper, an actuator, and a flytrap structure, are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB  - Soft robots offer significant advantages in adaptability, safety, and dexterity compared to conventional rigid-body robots. However, it is challenging to equip soft robots with accurate proprioception and tactile sensing due to their high flexibility and elasticity. In this work, we describe the development of a vision-based proprioceptive and tactile sensor for soft robots called GelFlex, which is inspired by previous GelSight sensing techniques. More specifically, we develop a novel exoskeleton-covered soft finger with embedded cameras and deep learning methods that enable high-resolution proprioceptive sensing and rich tactile sensing. To do so, we design features along the axial direction of the finger, which enable high-resolution proprioceptive sensing, and incorporate a reflective ink coating on the surface of the finger to enable rich tactile sensing. We design a highly underactuated exoskeleton with a tendon-driven mechanism to actuate the finger. Finally, we assemble 2 of the fingers together to form a robotic gripper and successfully perform a bar stock classification task, which requires both shape and tactile information. We train neural networks for proprioception and shape (box versus cylinder) classification using data from the embedded sensors. The proprioception CNN had over 99% accuracy on our testing set (all six joint angles were within 1Â° of error) and had an average accumulative distance error of 0.77 mm during live testing, which is better than human finger proprioception. These proposed techniques offer soft robots the high-level ability to simultaneously perceive their proprioceptive state and peripheral environment, providing potential solutions for soft robots to solve everyday manipulation tasks. We believe the methods developed in this work can be widely applied to different designs and applications.

AB  - Soft robots demonstrate great potential compared with traditional rigid robots owing to their inherently soft body structures. Although researchers have made tremendous progress in recent years, existing soft robots are in general plagued by a main issue: slow speeds and small forces. In this work, we aim to address this issue by actively designing the energy landscape of the soft body: the total strain energy with respect to the robot's deformation. With such a strategy, a soft robot's dynamics can be tuned to have fast and strong motion. We introduce the general design principle using a soft module with two stable states that can rapidly switch from one state to the other under external forces. We characterize the required triggering (switching) force with respect to design parameters (e.g., the initial shape of the module). We then apply the soft bistable module to develop fast and strong soft robots, whose triggering forces are generated by a soft actuator - twisted-and-coiled actuator (TCA). We demonstrate a soft gripper that can hold weights more than 8 times its own weight, and a soft jumping robot that can jump more than 5 times its body height. We envision our strategies will overcome the weakness of soft robots to unleash their potential for diverse applications.

AB  - Origami robots are well-suited for jumping maneuvers because of their light weight and ability to incorporate actuation and control strategies directly into the robot body. However, existing origami robots often model fold patterns as rigidly foldable and fail to take advantage of deformation in an origami sheet for potential energy storage. In this paper, we consider a parametric origami tessellation, the Reconfigurable Expanding Bistable Origami (REBO) pattern, which leverages face deformations to act as a nonlinear spring. We present a pseudo-rigid-body model for the REBO for computing its energy stored when compressed to a given displacement and compare that model to experimental measurements taken on a mechanical testing system. This stored potential energy, when released quickly, can cause the pattern to jump. Using our model and experimental data, we design and fabricate a jumping robot, REBOund, that uses the spring-like REBO pattern as its body. Four lightweight servo motors with custom release mechanisms allow for quick compression and release of the origami pattern, allowing the fold pattern to jump over its own height even when carrying 5 times its own weight in electronics and power. We further demonstrate that small geometric changes to the pattern allow us to change the jump height without changing the actuation or control mechanism.

AB  - Surface electromyography contains muscular information representing gestures and corresponding forces. However, conventional sEMG-based motion recognition methods, such as pattern classification and regression, have intrinsic limitations due to the complex characteristics of sEMG signals. In this paper, motion intensity, a highly selective sEMG feature proportional to the level of muscle contraction, is proposed. The motion intensity feature allows proportional and simultaneous recognition of multiple degrees of freedom. The proposed method was demonstrated in terms of simultaneous recognition of wrist/hand motions. The result shows that the proposed method can successfully decompose sEMG signals into highly selective signals to target motions. In future works, the proposed method will be adapted for more subjects and to sEMG applications for practical evaluation considering various grasping motions.

AB  - The development of algorithms for motion discrimination in home rehabilitation sessions poses numerous challenges. Recent studies have used the concept of synergies to discriminate a set of movements. However, the discrimination depends on the correlation of the reconstructed movement with the online data, and the training data requires well-defined movements. In this paper, we introduced the concept of a synergy probe, which makes a direct comparison between synergies and online data. The system represents synergies and movements in the same space and monitors their behavior. The results indicated that conventional methods are influenced by the segmentation of training data, and even though the reconstructed movement is similar to the ground-truth, it does not provide sufficient information to evaluate the data in real time. The synergy probes were used to discriminate and evaluate the performance of natural whole-body exercises without segmentation or previous determination of movements. An analysis of the results also demonstrated the possibility to identify the strategies used by the subjects for movement. Such information aids in gaining a better insight and can prove beneficial in home rehabilitation.

AB  - For those with irregular gait, re-calibration of motor control strategies and retraining of coordination are key goals. Thoughtful external forces or resistances during repetitive tasks can reprogram motor control patterns and strategies. Prior work in our lab has utilized this theory to improve gait in various patient groups using the Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD), a treadmill-based robotic trainer. In this paper, we propose a new, portable extension of the TPAD, which relies on an open-loop, forward kinematics based controller to remove the restriction of walking in the laboratory on a treadmill, and therefore accommodates overground ambulation. To evaluate the effects of this new control scheme and the effects of the users holding the mobile TPAD frame, a dataset of walking in four conditions was collected from eight healthy individuals. When applying a constant pelvic loading force of 10% body weight, the mean ground reaction force increased by 8.2Â±7.7% when the individual holds the walker frame and 11.1Â±7.8% when no hand contact is made. The mobile TPAD was shown to still induce a targeted loading on individuals during treadmill walking. The validation of this mobile device's controller and characterization of holding the frame allow overground studies to be conducted, and now opens the door to new training paradigms for overground gait training.

AB  - Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a promising technique for restoring reaching ability to individuals with tetraplegia. To this point, the complexities of goal-directed reaching motions and the shoulder-arm complex have prevented the realization of this potential in full-arm 3D reaching tasks. We trained a Gaussian process regression model to form the basis of a feedforward-feedback control structure capable of achieving reaching motions with a paralyzed upper limb. Over a series of 95 reaches of at least 10 cm in length, the controller achieved an average accuracy (measured by the Euclidean distance of the wrist to the final target position) of 3.8 cm and an average error along the path of 3.5 cm. This controller is the first demonstration of an accurate, complete-arm, FES-driven 3D reaching controller to be implemented with an individual with tetraplegia.

AB  - Relatively little work in human and robot control has examined the control of underactuated objects with internal dynamics, such as transporting a cup of coffee, a task that presents little problems for humans. This study examined how humans move a `cup of coffee' with a view to identify principles that may be useful for robot control. The specific focus was on how humans choose initial conditions to safely reach a steady state. We hypothesized that subjects choose initial conditions that minimized the transient duration to reach the steady state faster, as it presented more predictable dynamics. In the experiment, the cup of coffee was reduced to a 2-D cup with a sliding ball inside which was simulated in a virtual environment. Human subjects interacted with this virtual object via a robotic manipulandum that provided haptic feedback. Participants moved the cup between two targets without losing the ball; they were instructed to explore different initial conditions before initiating the continuous interaction. Results showed that subjects converged to a small set of initial conditions that decreased their transient durations and achieved a predictable steady state faster. Simulations with a simple feedforward controller and inverse dynamics calculations confirmed that these initial conditions indeed led to shorter transients and less complex interaction forces. These results may inform robot control of objects with internal dynamics where the effects of initial conditions need further investigation.

AB  - In today's automation driven manufacturing environments, emerging technologies like cobots (collaborative robots) and augmented reality interfaces can help integrating humans into the production workflow to benefit from their adaptability and cognitive skills. In such settings, humans are expected to work with robots side by side and physically interact with them. However, the trade-off between stability and transparency is a core challenge in the presence of physical human robot interaction (pHRI). While stability is of utmost importance for safety, transparency is required for fully exploiting the precision and ability of robots in handling labor intensive tasks. In this work, we propose a new variable admittance controller based on fractional order control to handle this trade-off more effectively. We compared the performance of fractional order variable admittance controller with a classical admittance controller with fixed parameters as a baseline and an integer order variable admittance controller during a realistic drilling task. Our comparisons indicate that the proposed controller led to a more transparent interaction compared to the other controllers without sacrificing the stability. We also demonstrate a use case for an augmented reality (AR) headset which can augment human sensory capabilities for reaching a certain drilling depth otherwise not possible without changing the role of the robot as the decision maker.

AB  - Autonomous robots have the potential to serve as versatile caregivers that improve quality of life for millions of people worldwide. Yet, conducting research in this area presents numerous challenges, including the risks of physical interaction between people and robots. Physics simulations have been used to optimize and train robots for physical assistance, but have typically focused on a single task. In this paper, we present Assistive Gym, an open source physics simulation framework for assistive robots that models multiple tasks. It includes six simulated environments in which a robotic manipulator can attempt to assist a person with activities of daily living (ADLs): itch scratching, drinking, feeding, body manipulation, dressing, and bathing. Assistive Gym models a person's physical capabilities and preferences for assistance, which are used to provide a reward function. We present baseline policies trained using reinforcement learning for four different commercial robots in the six environments. We demonstrate that modeling human motion results in better assistance and we compare the performance of different robots. Overall, we show that Assistive Gym is a promising tool for assistive robotics research.

AB  - This paper presents a learning-from-demonstration (LfD) framework for teaching human-robot social interactions that involve whole-body haptic interaction, i.e. direct human-robot contact over the full robot body. The performance of existing LfD frameworks suffers in such interactions due to the high dimensionality and spatiotemporal sparsity of the demonstration data. We show that by leveraging this sparsity, we can reduce the data dimensionality without incurring a significant accuracy penalty, and introduce three strategies for doing so. By combining these techniques with an LfD framework for learning multimodal human-robot interactions, we can model the spatiotemporal relationship between the tactile and kinesthetic information during whole-body haptic interactions. Using a teleoperated bimanual robot equipped with 61 force sensors, we experimentally demonstrate that a model trained with 121 sample hugs from 4 participants generalizes well to unseen inputs and human partners.

AB  - When a robot manipulator approaches a kinematic singular configuration, control strategies need to be employed to ensure safe and robust operation. If this manipulator is being controlled by a human through physical human-robot collaboration, the choice of strategy for handling singularities can have a significant effect on the feelings and impressions of the user. To date the preferences of humans during physical human-robot collaboration regarding strategies for managing kinematic singularities have yet to be thoroughly explored.This work presents an empirical study of a damping-based strategy for handling singularities with regard to the preferences of the human operator. Two different parameters, damping rate and damping asymmetry, are tested using a double-blind A/B pairwise comparison testing protocol. Participants included two cohorts made up of the general public (n=51) and people working within a robotic research centre (n=18). In total 105 individual trials were performed. Results indicate a preference for a faster, asymmetric damping behavior that slows motions towards singularities whilst allowing for faster motions away.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to create a new collaborative robotic system that subsumes the advantages of mobile manipulators and supernumerary limbs. By exploiting the reconfiguration potential of a MObile Collaborative robot Assistant (MOCA), we create a collaborative robot that can function autonomously, in close proximity to humans, or be physically coupled to the human counterpart as a supernumerary body (MOCA-MAN). Through an admittance interface and a hand gesture recognition system, the controller can give higher priority to the mobile base (e.g., for long distance co-carrying tasks) or the arm movements (e.g., for manipulating tools), when performing conjoined actions. The resulting system has a high potential not only to reduce waste associated with the equipment waiting and setup times, but also to mitigate the human effort when performing heavy or prolonged manipulation tasks. The performance of the proposed system, i.e., MOCA-MAN, is evaluated by multiple subjects in two different use-case scenarios, which require large mobility or close-proximity manipulation.

AB  - In the present paper, we first adopt explicit force control from general robotics and embed it into teleoperation systems to enhance the transparency by reducing the effect of the perceived inertia to the human operator and simultaneously improve contact perception. To ensure stability of the proposed teleoperation system considering time-delays, we propose a sequential design procedure based on time domain passivity approach. Experimental results of master-slave teleoperation system, based on KUKA light-weight-robots, for different values of delays are presented. Comparative analysis is conducted considering two existing approaches, namely 2-channel and 4-channel architecture based bilateral controllers, and its results clearly indicate significant improvement in force transparency owing to the proposed method. The proposed system is finally validated considering a real industrial assembly scenario.

AB  - Search and rescue robotics is becoming a relevant topic in the last years and the growing number of robotic platforms and dedicated projects is the evidence of the interest in this area. In this context, the possibility to drive a remote robot with an exoskeleton is a promising strategy to enhance dexterity, reduce operator effort and save time. However, the use of haptic feedback (bilateral teleoperation) may lead to instability in the presence of communication delay and more complex is the case of bimanual teleoperation where the two arms can exchange energy. In this work, we present a bimanual teleoperation system based on an exoskeletal master, where multi-degrees of freedom (multi-DoFs) and kinematically different devices are involved. In the implemented architecture the two slaves are managed in parallel and independently passivated using the Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) extended for multi-DoFs devices. To investigate the stability of the architecture we designed two tasks highly related to real disaster scenarios: the first one was useful to verify the system behavior in case of small movements and constrained configurations, whereas the second experiment was designed to involve larger contact forces and movements. Moreover, we compared the effect of both delay and low control loop frequency on the stability of the system when TDPA was applied. From the results, it was evident that the overall system exhibited a stable behavior with the use of the TDPA, even passivating the two slaves independently, under simulated time delay and in presence of a low control loop frequency.

AB  - Drone teleoperation is usually accomplished using remote radio controllers, devices that can be hard to master for inexperienced users. Moreover, the limited amount of information fed back to the user about the robot's state, often limited to vision, can represent a bottleneck for operation in several conditions. In this work, we present a wearable interface for drone teleoperation and its evaluation through a user study. The two main features of the proposed system are a data glove to allow the user to control the drone trajectory by hand motion and a haptic system used to augment their awareness of the environment surrounding the robot. This interface can be employed for the operation of robotic systems in line of sight (LoS) by inexperienced operators and allows them to safely perform tasks common in inspection and search-and-rescue missions such as approaching walls and crossing narrow passages with limited visibility conditions. In addition to the design and implementation of the wearable interface, we performed a systematic study to assess the effectiveness of the system through three user studies (n = 36) to evaluate the users' learning path and their ability to perform tasks with limited visibility. We validated our ideas in both a simulated and a real-world environment. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system can improve teleoperation performance in different cases compared to standard remote controllers, making it a viable alternative to standard Human-Robot Interfaces.

AB  - In some applications, operators may want to create fluid, human-like motion on a remotely-operated robot, for example, a device used for remote telepresence. This paper examines two methods of controlling the pose of a Baxter robot via an Xbox One controller. The first method is a joint- by-joint (JBJ) method in which one joint of each limb is specified in sequence. The second method of control, named Robot Choreography Center (RCC), utilizes choreographic abstractions in order to simultaneously move multiple joints of the limb of the robot in a predictable manner. Thirty-eight users were asked to perform four tasks with each method. Success rate and duration of successfully completed tasks were used to analyze the performances of the participants. Analysis of the preferences of the users found that the joint-by-joint (JBJ) method was considered to be more precise, easier to use, safer, and more articulate, while the choreography-inspired (RCC) method of control was perceived as faster, more fluid, and more expressive. Moreover, performance data found that while both methods of control were over 80% successful for the two static tasks, the RCC method was an average of 11.85% more successful for the two more difficult, dynamic tasks. Future work will leverage this framework to investigate ideas of fluidity, expressivity, and human-likeness in robotic motion through online user studies with larger participant pools.

AB  - As artificial intelligence becomes an increasingly prevalent method of enhancing robotic capabilities, it is important to consider effective ways to train these learning pipelines and to leverage human expertise. Working towards these goals, a master-apprentice model is presented and is evaluated during a grasping task for effectiveness and human perception. The apprenticeship model augments self-supervised learning with learning by demonstration, efficiently using the human's time and expertise while facilitating future scalability to supervision of multiple robots; the human provides demonstrations via virtual reality when the robot cannot complete the task autonomously. Experimental results indicate that the robot learns a grasping task with the apprenticeship model faster than with a solely self-supervised approach and with fewer human interventions than a solely demonstration-based approach; 100% grasping success is obtained after 150 grasps with 19 demonstrations. Preliminary user studies evaluating workload, usability, and effectiveness of the system yield promising results for system scalability and deployability. They also suggest a tendency for users to overestimate the robot's skill and to generalize its capabilities, especially as learning improves.

AB  - Virtual fixtures (VFs) improve human operator performance in teleoperation scenarios. However, the generation of VFs is challenging, especially in unstructured environments. In this work, we introduce a framework for the interactive generation of VF. The method is based on the observation that a human can easily understand just by looking at the remote environment which VF could help in task execution. We propose a user interface that detects features on camera images and permits interactive selection of the features. We demonstrate how the feature selection can be used for designing VF, providing 6-DOF haptic feedback. In order to make the proposed framework more generally applicable to a wider variety of applications, we formalize the process of virtual fixture generation (VFG) into the specification of features, geometric primitives, and constraints. The framework can be extended further by the introduction of additional components. Through the human subject study, we demonstrate the proposed framework is intuitive, easy to use while effective, especially for performing hard contact tasks.

AB  - This paper focuses on local path planning for obstacle avoidance tasks dedicated to off-road mobile robots. This approach calculates a new local path for the vehicle using a set of cubic Bezier curves once the safety distance is not respected; otherwise, the vehicle follows the global reference path which is defined off-line. Two basic steps are used to determine this new path. Firstly, some significant points that should belong to the planned path are extracted on-line according to the obstacle's sizes and the current state of the vehicle, these points are approved as waypoints. Secondly, on-line cubic Bezier curves are computed to create a smooth path for these points such that the safety and lateral stability of the vehicle are ensured (i.e., preventing huge curvatures and wide-variation in steering angles). This path will be used as a reference to be performed by the vehicle using a constrained model predictive control. The validation of our navigation strategy is performed via numerical simulations and experiments using a fast double-steering rover.

AB  - Collision avoidance is a key technology towards safe human-robot interaction, especially on-line and fastreacting motions are required. Skins with proximity sensors mounted on the robot's outer shell provide an interesting approach to occlusion-free and low-latency perception. However, collision avoidance algorithms which make extensive use of these properties for fast-reacting motions have not yet been fully investigated. We present an improved collision avoidance algorithm for proximity sensing skins by formulating a quadratic optimization problem with inequality constraints to compute instantaneous optimal joint velocities. Compared to common repulsive force methods, our algorithm confines the approach velocity to obstacles and keeps motions pointing away from obstacles unrestricted. Since with repulsive motions the robot only moves in one direction, opposite to obstacles, our approach has better exploitation of the redundancy space to maintain the task motion and gets stuck less likely in local minima. Furthermore, our method incorporates an active behaviour for avoiding obstacles and evaluates all potentially colliding obstacles for the whole arm, rather than just the single nearest obstacle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with simulations and on real robot manipulators in comparison with commonly used repulsive force methods and our prior proposed approach.

AB  - Horizontally scanning 2D laser rangefinders are a popular approach for indoor robot localization because of the high accuracy of the sensors and the compactness of the required 2D maps. As the scanners in this configuration only provide information about one slice of the environment, the measurements typically do not capture the full extent of a large variety of obstacles, including chairs or tables. Accordingly, obstacle avoidance based on laser scanners mounted in such a fashion is likely to fail. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach to predict collisions in 2D occupancy maps. Our approach is based on a convolutional neural network which is trained on a 2D occupancy map and collision events recorded with a bumper while the robot is navigating in its environment. As the network operates on local structures only, it can generalize to new environments. In addition, the robot can collect and integrate new collision examples after an initial training phase. Extensive experiments carried out in simulation and a realistic real-world environment confirm that our approach allows robots to learn from collision events to avoid collisions in the future.

AB  - State of the art methods for robotic path planning in dynamic environments, such as crowds or traffic, rely on hand crafted motion models for agents. These models often do not reflect interactions of agents in real world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an integrated path planning framework using generative Recurrent Neural Networks within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach uses a learnt model of social response to predict crowd dynamics during planning across the action space. This extends our recent work using generative RNNs to learn the relationship between planned robotic actions and the likely response of a crowd. We show that the proposed framework can considerably improve motion prediction accuracy during interactions, allowing more effective path planning. The performance of our method is compared in simulation with existing methods for collision avoidance in a crowd of pedestrians, demonstrating the ability to control future states of nearby individuals. We also conduct preliminary real world tests to validate the effectiveness of our method.

This framework is applied at the controller level and provides safety regardless of the planner that is used. The method is shown to be robust to state uncertainty and disturbances, and is computed entirely online utilizing the full nonlinear system dynamics. The effectiveness of this method is shown in a high-fidelity simulation of a quadrotor with onboard sensors rapidly and safely exploring a cave environment utilizing a simple planner.

AB  - We propose thrombolysis using a magnetic nanoparticle microswarm with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) under ultrasound imaging. The microswarm is generated in blood using an oscillating magnetic field and can be navigated with locomotion along both the long and short axis. By modulating the input field, the aspect ratio of the microswarm can be reversibly tuned, showing the ability to adapt to different confined environments. Simulation results indicate that both in-plane and out-of-plane fluid convection are induced around the microswarm, which can be further enhanced by tuning the aspect ratio of the microswarm. Under ultrasound imaging, the microswarm is navigated in a microchannel towards a blood clot and deformed to obtain optimal lysis. Experimental results show that the lysis rate reaches -0.1725 Â± 0.0612 mm3/min in the 37Â°C blood environment under the influence of the microswarm-induced fluid convection and tPA. The lysis rate is enhanced 2.5-fold compared to that without the microswarm (-0.0681 Â± 0.0263 mm3/min). Our method provides a new strategy to increase the efficiency of thrombolysis by applying microswarm-induced fluid convection, indicating that swarming micro/nanorobots have the potential to act as effective tools towards targeted therapy.

AB  - Micromanipulation is challenging due to the specific physical effects governing the microworld. Interactive approaches using only visual feedback are limited to the 2D image of the microscope, and have forcibly lower bandwidth. Recently, haptic feedback teleoperation systems have been developed to try to overcome those difficulties. This paper explores the case of an optical tweezers platform coupled to an haptic device providing transparent force feedback. The impact of haptic feedback regarding user dexterity on tactile exploration tasks is studied using 3 Î¼m microbeads and a test bench with micro sized shapes. The results reveal a consistent improvement in both users' trajectory tracking and their control of the contact forces. This also validates the experimental setup which performed reliably on 140 different trials of the evaluation.

AB  - This paper presents a novel steering mechanism, which leads to frequency-controlled locomotion demonstrated for the first time in micro bristle robots. The miniaturized robots are 3D-printed, 12 mm Ã— 8 mm Ã— 6 mm in size, with bristle feature sizes down to 400 Î¼m. The robots can be steered by utilizing the distinct resonance behaviors of the asymmetrical bristle sets. The left and right sets of the bristles have different diameters, and thus different stiffnesses and resonant frequencies. The unique response of each bristle side to the vertical vibrations of a single on-board piezoelectric actuator causes differential steering of the robot. The robot can be modeled as two coupled uniform bristle robots, representing the left and the right sides. At distinct frequencies, the robots can move in all four principal directions: forward, backward, left and right. Furthermore, the full 360Â° 2D plane can be covered by superimposing the principal actuation frequency components with desired amplitudes. In addition to miniaturized robots, the presented resonance-based steering mechanism can be applied over multiple scales and to other mechanical systems.

We achieved this using a design and fabrication process that is flexible, allowing scaling with minimum changes to our workflow. We further characterized HAMR-Jr's open-loop locomotion and compared it with the larger scale HAMR-VI microrobot to demonstrate the effectiveness of scaling laws in predicting running performance.

AB  - We consider problems in which robots conspire to present a view of the world that differs from reality. The inquiry is motivated by the problem of validating robot behavior physically despite there being a discrepancy between the robots we have at hand and those we wish to study, or the environment for testing that is available versus that which is desired, or other potential mismatches in this vein. After formulating the concept of a convincing illusion, essentially a notion of system simulation that takes place in the real world, we examine the implications of this type of simulability in terms of infrastructure requirements. Time is one important resource: some robots may be able to simulate some others but, perhaps, only at a rate that is slower than real-time. This difference gives a way of relating the simulating and the simulated systems in a form that is relative. We establish some theorems, including one with the flavor of an impossibility result, and providing several examples throughout. Finally, we present data from a simple multi-robot experiment based on this theory, with a robot navigating amid an unbounded field of obstacles."Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies."-Ralph Waldo Emerson.

The underlying premise of this approach is that the robot has a set of actions, or skills, that can be composed to achieve the high- level task. In this paper we consider LTL specifications that cannot be synthesized into robot control due to lack of appropriate skills; we present algorithms for automatically suggesting new or modified skills for the robot that will guarantee the task will be achieved. We demonstrate our approach with a physical Baxter robot and a simulated KUKA IIWA arm.

AB  - We consider the problem of optimal reactive synthesis - compute a strategy that satisfies a mission specification in a dynamic environment, and optimizes a given performance metric. We incorporate task-critical information, that is only available at runtime, into the strategy synthesis in order to improve performance. Existing approaches to utilising such time-varying information require online re-synthesis, which is not computationally feasible in real-time applications. In this paper, we presynthesize a set of strategies corresponding to candidate instantiations (pre-specified representative information scenarios). We then propose a novel switching mechanism to dynamically switch between the strategies at runtime while guaranteeing all safety and liveness goals are met. We also characterize bounds on the performance suboptimality. We demonstrate our approach on two examples - robotic motion planning where the likelihood of the position of the robot's goal is updated in real-time, and an air traffic management problem for urban air mobility.

We introduce a novel rewarding and discounting mechanism based on the LTL formula such that (i) an optimal policy maximizing the total discounted reward effectively maximizes the probabilities of satisfying LTL objectives, and (ii) a model-free RL algorithm using these rewards and discount factors is guaranteed to converge to such a policy. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our RL-based synthesis approach on two motion planning case studies.

AB  - This paper introduces an intrinsically safe parallel manipulator dedicated to fast pick-and-place operations, called R-Min. It has been designed to reduce the risk of injury during a collision with a human operator, while maintaining high speed and acceleration. The proposed architecture is based on a modification of the well-known planar five-bar mechanism, where additional passive joints are introduced to the distal links in order to create a planar seven-bar mechanism with two degrees of underactuation, so that it can passively reconfigure in case of collision. A supplementary passive leg, in which a tension spring is mounted, is added between the base and the end-effector in order to constrain the additional degrees of freedom. A prototype of this new collaborative parallel robot is designed and its equilibrium configurations under several types of loadings are analyzed. Its dynamics is also studied. We analyze the impact force occurring during a collision between our prototype and the head of an operator and compare these results with those that would have been obtained with a rigid five-bar mechanism. Simulation results of impact during a standard pick-and-place trajectory of duration 0.3 s show that a regular five-bar mechanism would injure a human, while our robot would avoid the trauma.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a parallel six-wheel-legged robot that can traverse irregular terrain while carrying objectives to do heavy-duty work. This robot is equipped with six Stewart platforms as legs and tightly integrates the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the wheels. The presented control strategy with physical system used to adapt the diverse degrees of each leg to irregular terrain such that robot increases the traversability, and simultaneously to maintain the horizontal whole-torso pose. This strategy makes use of Contact Scheduler (CS) and Whole-Torso Control (WTC) to control the multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) leg for performing high-flexibility locomotion and adapting the rough terrain like actively parallel suspension system. We conducted experiments on flat, slope, soft and sand-gravel surface, which validate the proposed control method and physical system. Especially, we attempt to traverse over sand-gravel terrain with 3 people about 240kg payload.

AB  - This paper presents the development and results of a large 3 d.o.f cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) that has been extensively used between June and August 2019 for an artistic exhibition. The purpose of the exhibition was to 3D print a wall of glass powder, which will slowly collapse after the deposit of each layer. Positioning control on the assigned trajectory was an issue because of the CDPR geometry imposed by the specific configuration of the exhibition place. We describe how this problem was solved using a combination of cable length estimation based on the winch rotation measured by encoder, together with 3 on-board lidars that were used to provide a measure of the robot position. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such method was used for controlling a large CDPR. This CDPR has run for 174 hours since 6/18/2019, averaging a run time of 4h15mn per day. The 3D printing of the wall started on 7/18/2019 and stops on 8/31/2019. During this period the robot was used for 32 days with an average of 2h18mn run-time per day. The robot has traveled on a total distance of 4757 meters, of which 3893 meters on the assigned trajectory. During the period 76 layers have been deposited, representing a mass of 1.5 tons of glass powder.

AB  - The 3-CRS manipulator is an original parallel mechanism having 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs) with only 3 limbs. This mechanism uses a motorized cylindrical joint per limb. This new paradigm of actuation opens research fields on new families of robots that should particularly interest the parallel robotics community. According to its dimensional synthesis, this mechanism can have remarkable kinematic properties such as a large orientation workspace or reconfiguration capabilities. In this paper, we introduce this mechanism and we study its singularities by using a geometric approach. This approach simplifies considerably singularity analysis problem by considering the relative geometric configurations of three planes defined by the distal links of the limbs. Thanks to that, a reconfiguration mode of the 3-CRS, that doubles its reachable workspace, is highlighted. This property is illustrated on a physical prototype of the robot.

AB  - We present a novel class of robots belonging to Constrained Collaborative Mobile Agents (CCMA) family which consists of ground mobile bases with non-holonomic constraints. Moreover, these mobile robots are constrained by closed-loop kinematic chains consisting of revolute joints which can be either passive or actuated. We also describe a novel trajectory optimization method which is general with respect to number of mobile robots, topology of the closed- loop kinematic chains and placement of the actuators at the revolute joints. We also extend the standalone trajectory optimization method to optimize concurrently the design parameters and the control policy. We describe various CCMA system examples, in simulation, differing in design, topology, number of mobile robots and actuation space. The simulation results for standalone trajectory optimization with fixed design parameters is presented for CCMA system examples. We also show how this method can be used for tasks other than end-effector positioning such as internal collision avoidance and external obstacle avoidance. The concurrent design and control policy optimization is demonstrated, in simulations, to increase the CCMA system workspace and manipulation capabilities. Finally, the trajectory optimization method is validated in experiments through two 4-DOF prototypes consisting of 3 tracked mobile bases.

AB  - A wheeled robot operating on various terrains such as scattered obstacles and slopes is required to cope with and overcome the driving environment. In this paper, in order to overcome a step-type obstacle and to steadily ascend on the slope, the main body rotation mechanism, which controls the load distribution on the robot wheels was proposed for a wheel-drive robot. By rotating the center of the body mass, the friction/traction force required for climbing step obstacles can be reduced. In the case of slope traveling, the slip can be suppressed, and the traveling ability improved by controlling the load distribution excessively increased on the downhill wheel due to the attitude change of the robot's body. The mechanical effect of the proposed body rotation mechanism was analyzed. In addition, based on the design and manufacture of the robot platform, the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism was convincingly demonstrated by indoor test for step-obstacle climbing and slope-traveling.

AB  - With the availability of small system in package realizations, radar systems become more and more attractive for a variety of applications in robotics, in particular also for collaborative robotics. As the simulation of robot systems in realistic scenarios has become an important tool, not only for design and optimization, but also e.g. for machine learning approaches, realistic simulation models are needed. In the case of radar sensor simulations, this means providing more realistic results than simple proximity sensors, e.g. in the presence of multiple objects and/or humans, objects with different relative velocities and differentiation between background and foreground movement. Due to the short wavelength in the millimeter range, we propose to utilize methods known from computer graphics (e.g. z-buffer, Lambertian reflectance model) to quickly acquire depth images and reflection estimates. This information is used to calculate an estimate of the received signal for a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar by superposition of the corresponding signal contributions. Due to the moderate computational complexity, the approach can be used with various simulation environments such as V-Rep or Gazebo. Validity and benefits of the approach are demonstrated by means of a comparison with experimental data obtained with a radar sensor on a UR10 arm in different scenarios.

AB  - While robots can learn models to solve many manipulation tasks from raw visual input, they cannot usually use these models to solve new problems. On the other hand, symbolic planning methods such as STRIPS have long been able to solve new problems given only a domain definition and a symbolic goal, but these approaches often struggle on the real world robotic tasks due to the challenges of grounding these symbols from sensor data in a partially-observable world. We propose Deep Planning Domain Learning (DPDL), an approach that combines the strengths of both methods to learn a hierarchical model. DPDL learns a high-level model which predicts values for a large set of logical predicates consisting of the current symbolic world state, and separately learns a low-level policy which translates symbolic operators into executable actions on the robot. This allows us to perform complex, multistep tasks even when the robot has not been explicitly trained on them. We show our method on manipulation tasks in a photorealistic kitchen scenario.
