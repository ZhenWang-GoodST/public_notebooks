AB  - This paper presents a novel permanent magnets based actuator capable of injecting and 2D wireless control the motion of an untethered microrobot. The actuator is obtained with a simple, but an effective arrangement of four permanent magnets. Its novelty is that it creates local maxima of the magnetic field magnitude in a planar workspace. This results in a convergence point for magnetic microrobots that are in its influence zone. Trapping microrobots in the local maxima makes their open-loop guidance possible, even in presence of reasonable perturbations. Actually, open-loop control is the only way to achieve some drug delivery when there are no sensors to provide us a feedback on the microrobot's positions. With the proposed actuator, the workspace is reduced, the movement is simplified and the actuator orientation is not needed anymore. Experimental results are provided in the paper to show the soundness of the proposed actuator design.

AB  - A hybrid manufacturing process combining abrasive jet and laser micromaching enables the creation of living hinges in nitinol that retain the superelastic properties of the bulk material. The former selectively etches through the thickness of a workpiece and the latter defines the part's final geometry. Because the majority of the material removal is done with the room-temperature mechanical etching procedure, thermal damage to the part is minimized. Processing parameters to achieve desired geometries are described, a bending stiffness model for the living hinges is provided, and validation experiments are presented. Lastly, to demonstrate the usefulness of these components to millimeter-sized robotic systems and medical devices, we show their integration in two prototype devices: an endoscopic camera wrist and a simple laser beam steering system.

AB  - Current minimally-invasive surgical tools suffer from lack of scalability and restricted access to some surgical sites using a laparoscopic probe. This paper introduces a proof-of-concept prototype of the first completely wireless surgical scissors capable of dexterous motion and cutting in a remote environment as a mobile microrobotic device. The 15 mm untethered surgical scissors are custom made from sharpened titanium sheets with a magnet on each blade for actuating force and control. A super-elastic nitinol wire acts as a restoring spring and results in a simple design with no pin joint which is difficult to fabricate at small sizes. To actuate and control the scissors, a 3D magnetic coil system is used here for testing and demonstration. An external magnetic flux density of 20 mT can be generated using the coils and is used for cutting as well as orienting, moving and closing the scissors. In this first prototype setup, the scissors can generate up to 75 mN of cutting force, and we demonstrate the cutting of agar. As a proof of concept demonstration of the potential use of the scissors as a completely untethered surgical tool, we robotically maneuver the scissors to a target location in a confined environment where they cut through agar and return to their initial position.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) bending sensor for shape memory alloy (SMA) bending modules. Due to the small form factor, low cost, and large-deflection capability, SMA bending modules can be used to construct disposable surgical robots for a variety of minimally invasive procedures. To realize a closed-loop control of SMA bending modules, an intrinsic bending sensor is imperative. Due to the lack of bending sensors for SMA bending modules, we have developed an FBG bending sensor by integrating FBG fibers with a superelastic substrate using flexible adhesive. Since the substrate is ultra-thin and adhesive is flexible, the sensor has low stiffness and can measure large curvatures. Additionally, due to the orthogonal arrangement of the sensor/actuator assembly, the influence of temperature variation caused by SMA actuation can be compensated. The working principle of the developed sensor was modeled followed by simulations. After experimentally evaluating the developed model, the sensor was integrated with an SMA bending module and cyclically bi-directionally deflected. The experimental results proved the relatively high measurement accuracy, high repeatability, and large measurable curvatures of the sensor, although hysteresis was observed due to friction.

AB  - Ground robots which are able to navigate a variety of terrains are needed in many domains. One of the key aspects is the capability to adapt to the ground structure, which can be realized through movable body parts coming along with additional degrees of freedom (DoF). However, planning respective locomotion is challenging since suitable representations result in large state spaces. Employing an additional abstract representation-which is coarser, lower-dimensional, and semantically enriched-can support the planning. While a desired robot representation and action set of such an abstract representation can be easily defined, the cost function requires large tuning efforts. We propose a method to represent the cost function as a CNN. Training of the network is done on generated artificial data, while it generalizes well to the abstraction of real world scenes. We further apply our method to the problem of search-based planning of hybrid driving-stepping locomotion. The abstract representation is used as a powerful informed heuristic which accelerates planning by multiple orders of magnitude.

AB  - Path planners are generally categorised as either trajectory optimisers or sampling-based planners. The latter is the predominant planning paradigm for occupancy maps. Most trajectory optimisers require a fully defined artificial potential field for planning and cannot incorporate updates from a partially observed model such as an occupancy map. A stochastic trajectory optimiser capable of planning over occupancy map was presented in [1]. However, its scalability is limited by the cubic complexity of the Gaussian process path representation. In this work, we introduce a novel highly expressive path representation based on kernel approximation to perform trajectory optimisation over occupancy maps. This approach reduces the computational complexity to a fixed cost that only depends on the number of features. We show that stochastic sampling is crucial for planning in occupancy maps and present comparisons to other state-of-the-art planning methods, using simulated and real occupancy data. These experiments demonstrate the significant reduction in runtime, resulting in performance comparable to or better than sampling-based methods.

AB  - Robust motion planning is a well-studied problem in the robotics literature, yet current algorithms struggle to operate scalably and safely in the presence of other moving agents, such as humans. This paper introduces a novel framework for robot navigation that accounts for high-order system dynamics and maintains safety in the presence of external disturbances, other robots, and humans. Our approach precomputes a tracking error margin for each robot, generates confidence-aware human motion predictions, and coordinates multiple robots with a sequential priority ordering, effectively enabling scalable safe trajectory planning and execution. We demonstrate our approach in hardware with two robots and two humans, and showcase scalability in a larger simulation.

AB  - Nowadays robotic systems are expected to share workspaces and collaborate with humans. In such collaborative environments, an important challenge is to ground or establish the correct semantic interpretation of a human request. Once such an interpretation is available, the request must be translated into robot motion commands in order to complete the desired task. It is not unusual that a human request cannot be grounded to a unique interpretation, thus leading to an ambiguous request. A simple example is to ask a robot to “put a cup on the table,” when there are multiple cups available. In order to deal with this kind of ambiguous request, we propose a delayed or lazy variable grounding. The focus of this paper is a motion planning algorithm that, given goal regions that represent different valid groundings, lazily finds a feasible path to any one valid grounding. This algorithm includes a reward-penalty strategy, which attempts to prioritize those goal regions that seem more promising to provide a solution. We validate our approach by solving requests with multiple valid alternatives in both simulation and real-world experiments.

AB  - This work addresses the problem of robot navigation under timed temporal specifications in workspaces cluttered with obstacles. We propose a hybrid control strategy that guarantees the accomplishment of a high-level specification expressed as a timed temporal logic formula, while preserving safety (i.e., obstacle avoidance) of the system. In particular, we utilize a motion controller that achieves safe navigation inside the workspace in predetermined time, thus allowing us to abstract the motion of the agent as a finite timed transition system among certain regions of interest. Next, we employ standard formal verification and convex optimization techniques to derive high-level timed plans that satisfy the agent's specifications. A simulation study illustrates and clarifies the proposed scheme.

AB  - This paper presents a holistic approach for door opening with a cartesian impedance controlled mobile robot, a KUICA KMR iiwa. Based on a given map of the environment, the robot autonomously detects the door handle, opens doors and traverses doorways without knowledge of a door model or the door's geometry. The door handle detection uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture to obtain the handle's bounding box in a RGB image that works robustly for various handle shapes and colors. We achieve a detection rate of 100% for an evaluation set of 38 different door handles, by always selecting for highest confidence score. Registered depth data segmentation defines the door plane to construct a handle coordinate frame. We introduce a control structure based on the task frame formalism that uses the handle frame for reference in an outer loop for the manipulator's impedance controller. It runs in soft real-time on an external computer with approximately 20 Hz since access to inner controller loops is not available for the KMR iiwa. With the approach proposed in this paper, the robot successfully opened and traversed for 22 out of 25 trials at five different doors.

AB  - This paper presents the development and testing of end-to-end Neural Network (NN) controllers for automated pile loading with a robotic wheel loader. NNs were trained using the Learning from Demonstration approach, i.e. by first recording sensor and control signals during manually-driven pile loading actions. Training made use of three input signals: boom angle, bucket angle and hydrostatic driving pressure; and three output signals: boom control, bucket control and the gas command. Most testing was conducted using NNs with 5 neurons in a single hidden layer, which were able to fill the bucket reasonably well. Qualitative comparisons were made to ascertain how the amount of training data and number of hidden neurons affects bucket filling performance, for NNs trained using both the Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularization backpropagation algorithms. Different NNs trained with the same data were also compared. An additional pile transfer experiment compared the performance of an NN controller with a heuristic automated controller and manual human control. By estimating the total volume of material transferred using 3D laser scans, human control was found to have the highest performance, though the NN outperformed the heuristic controller. This indicated that end-to-end NN control trained by demonstration could offer improvement over current heuristic methods for automated pile loading.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel configurable wheel that exhibits desired properties of varied radius wheels. Positional manipulation of the centre hub is proposed and tested to achieve these desired characteristics of `virtual' wheels in a physical system. The centre hub is manipulated via the use of pneumatic actuators mounted to and constricted by the outer rim of the wheel, which allows for fast and accurate control to enable the vehicle ride height and gear ratio to be adjusted continuously and be maintained during the wheels' full rotation. Experiments are presented, validating this ability of the system. We envision uses for this system to extend from off-road robotics to space exploration as these wheels exhibit novel characteristics not demonstrated by other platforms.

We develop a general framework involving differential-algebraic equations and viability theory to describe and determine coordination feasibility for a coordinated motion control under heterogeneous vehicle dynamics and various constraints. A heuristic algorithm is proposed for generating feasible trajectories for each individual vehicle. We show several application examples and simulation experiments on multi-vehicle coordination under various constraints to validate the theory and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and control schemes.

AB  - Multirobot coverage is the problem of planning paths for several identical robots such that the combined regions traced out by the robots completely cover their environment. We consider the problem of multirobot coverage with the objective of minimizing the mission time, which depends on the number of turns taken by the robots. To solve this problem, we first partition the environment into ranks which are long thin rectangles the width of the robot's coverage tool. Our novel partitioning heuristic produces a set of ranks which minimizes the number of turns. Next, we solve a variant of the multiple travelling salesperson problem (m-TSP) on the set of ranks to minimize the robots' mission time. The resulting coverage plan is guaranteed to cover the entire environment. We present coverage plans for a robotic vacuum using real maps of 25 indoor environments and compare the solutions to paths planned without the objective of minimizing turns. Turn minimization reduced the number of turns by 6.7% and coverage time by 3.8% on average for teams of 1-5 robots.

AB  - In this work, we consider the problem of online centralized kinodynamic multi-robot replanning (from potentially non-stationary initial states) and coordination in known and cluttered workspaces. Offline state lattice reachability analysis is leveraged to decouple the planning problem into two sequential graph searches-one in the explicit geometric graph of the environment and the other in the graph of the higher-order derivatives of the robot's state-in a manner such that the intermediate vertices of a safe set of geometric paths are guaranteed to have a feasible assignment of higher-order derivatives. Without additional iterative refinement procedures, the resulting time parameterized polynomial trajectories are dynamically feasible and collision-free. Planning results with up to 20 robots in two and three dimensional workspaces suggest the suitability of the proposed approach for multi-robot replanning in known environments.

AB  - Multi-robot systems are deployed in a warehouse to automate the process of storing and retrieving objects in and out of the warehouse. The efficiency of the system largely depends on how the tasks are allocated to the robots. Though there exists a number of techniques that can perform multi-robot task allocation quite efficiently, they hardly consider deadline for task completion while assigning tasks to the robots. A careful allocation is of paramount importance when there is an associated penalty with each of the tasks if it is not completed within a stipulated time. In this work, we develop an algorithm, called Minimum Penalty Scheduling (MPS) that allocates tasks among a group of robots with the goal that the overall penalty of executing all the tasks can be minimized. Our algorithm provides a robust, scalable, and near-optimal real-time task schedule. By comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithm, we show that MPS attracts up to 62.5% less penalty when a significant number of tasks are bound to miss the deadline. Additionally, MPS is also suitable for real-time multi-processor scheduling since it schedules a higher number of tasks within their deadline.

AB  - We present an augmented reality human-swarm interface that combines two modalities of interaction: environment-oriented and robot-oriented. The environment-oriented modality allows the user to modify the environment (either virtual or physical) to indicate a goal to attain for the robot swarm. The robot-oriented modality makes it possible to select individual robots to reassign them to other tasks to increase performance or remedy failures. Previous research has concluded that environment-oriented interaction might prove more difficult to grasp for untrained users. In this paper, we report a user study which indicates that, at least in collective transport, environment-oriented interaction is more effective than purely robot-oriented interaction, and that the two combined achieve remarkable efficacy.

AB  - We propose a combined method for the collaborative transportation of a suspended payload by a team of rotorcraft. A recent distance-based formation-motion control algorithm based on assigning distance disagreements among robots generates the acceleration signals to be tracked by the vehicles. In particular, the proposed method does not need global positions nor tracking prescribed trajectories for the motion of the members of the team. The acceleration signals are followed accurately by an Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion controller designed for rotorcraft that measures and resists the tensions from the payload. Our approach allows us to analyze the involved accelerations and forces in the system so that we can calculate the worst case conditions explicitly to guarantee a nominal performance, provided that the payload starts at rest in the 2D centroid of the formation, and it is not under significant disturbances. For example, we can calculate the maximum safe deformation of the team with respect to its desired shape. We demonstrate our method with a team of four rotorcraft carrying a suspended object two times heavier than the maximum payload for an individual. Last but not least, our proposed algorithm is available for the community in the open-source autopilot Paparazzi.

AB  - Tracking multiple prioritized tasks simultaneously with redundant robots have been investigated extensively over the last decades. Recent research focuses on combining advantages from both classical soft and strict prioritization schemes which is non-trivial. Among the proposed methods to tackle this issue, Generalized Hierarchical Control (GHC) seems to have a reasonable performance, however, it does not include a weighting matrix in the computation of the nullspace projection operator and hence cannot construct dynamically-consistent stack-of-tasks hierarchies as a special case. We extend GHC by adding dynamic-consistency to the control scheme and refer to it as DynGHC. The extension is also advantageous when choosing non-strict priorities because inertia coupling between tasks is reduced. DynGHC allows to smoothly rearrange priorities which is important for robots acting in dynamically changing contexts. Comparative simulations with a 4 DOF planar manipulator and a KUKA LWR validate our approach. Matlab and C++ source code is made available.

AB  - The control of human hands and fingers represents one of the most complex functions of the motor cortex. In order to implement anthropomorphic hands that mimic accurately the motion ability of the human hands, the basic biological mechanisms of the natural muscle control should be modelled. This paper presents the design of a significantly improved control system based on analogue neural networks that can be used to replicate the biological control mechanisms of the natural muscles. In order to demonstrate the proposed concept, experiments were performed using a single-joint robotic arm that can be flexed as the human elbow by an artificial muscle connected as the biceps. In order to bring more biological plausibility to the robotic arm, the artificial muscle is implemented using a shape memory alloy wire which actuates by contraction as the natural muscles. Moreover, the contraction force of the actuator wire is directly determined by the spiking frequency of the electronic neurons as the motor neurons determines the contraction strength of the natural muscles. The experimental results show that using excitatory neurons and several inhibitory neurons unevenly distributed on the inputs of the artificial motor neurons that drive the shape memory alloy actuator, the spiking neural network is able to control with high precision the rotation of the arm mobile lever to random target positions even if the arm is slightly loaded. These results validate the control method of the robotic arm junction showing that the analogue spiking neural networks represents a very good alternative to control the contraction of SMA actuators in a biological plausible manner.

AB  - The inverted pendulum is by nature a dynamically unstable system and may be subjected to severe disturbances due to its environmental or loading conditions. This paper formulates a design for a nonlinear controller to balance a two-wheeled mobile robot (TWMR) based on Model Reference Adaptive Control. The proposed solution overcomes the limitations of control systems that rely on fixed parameter controllers. Given the nonlinear single-input multi-output (SIMO) nature of the TWMR platform, the proposed adaptive controller can handle non-linearities without the need for linearization, and inherently dealing with SIMO systems. By studying the influence that hidden dynamic effects can cause, we show the preference of the proposed controller over other designs. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our proposed design, and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in guaranteeing asymptotic output tracking, even in the presence of unknown disturbances.

AB  - This paper presents a robust controller for uncertain robot manipulators subject to disturbances which are composed of sinusoids. The controller employs the disturbance observer based controller which can effectively estimate and compensate the effect of plant uncertainties and the disturbances. Assuming that the frequencies of sinusoids are known, we embed the internal model of disturbances into the proposed controller so that the design parameters of the controller can be chosen without using the magnitude of disturbance or its time derivative. A rigorous stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system under the proposed controller behaves like the nominal closed-loop system free of disturbances. Simulation results for a 2-DOF manipulator show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB  - The control of field robots in varying and uncertain terrain conditions presents a challenge for autonomous navigation. Online estimation of the wheel-terrain slip characteristics is essential for generating the accurate control predictions necessary for tracking trajectories in off-road environments. Receding horizon estimation (RHE) provides a powerful framework for constrained estimation, and when combined with receding horizon control (RHC), yields an adaptive optimisation-based control method. Presently, such methods assume slip to be constant over the estimation horizon, while our proposed structured blocking approach relaxes this assumption, resulting in improved state and parameter estimation. We demonstrate and compare the performance of this method in simulation, and propose an overlapping-block strategy to ameliorate some of the limitations encountered in applying noise-blocking in a receding horizon estimation and control (RHEC) context.

AB  - In contrast to underactuated robotic hands the DLR AWIWI II hand of the David robot is fully controllable because each finger with 4 joints is actuated by 6 or 8 tendons respectively. For such fingers all joint angles (generalized positions) or joint torques (generalized forces) can be controlled independently. Usually, the specifications in joint space are converted to desired tendon forces or motor torques, which are regulated by an inner loop impedance controller. However, this conversion typically exhibits couplings between the components of the joint angle vector or the joint torque vector respectively, which arise when using the well known equations. Therefore the usual force control and position control schemes are reviewed and a generic computation of the desired tendon forces is presented. This is also done for the control of the Cartesian position and force at the finger endpoint. Thus the main contribution of the paper is the inhibition of couplings in joint space or at the Cartesian endpoint. This is demonstrated in simulations of the index finger of the DLR David hand.

AB  - We propose a reconfigurable network for efficient inference dedicated to autonomous platforms equipped with multiple perception sensors. The size of the network for steering autonomous platforms grows proportionally to the number of installed sensors eventually preventing the usage of multiple sensors in real-time applications due to an inefficient inference. Our approach hinges on the observation that multiple sensors provide a large stream of data, where only a fraction of the data is relevant for the performed task at any given moment in time. The architecture of the reconfigurable network that we propose contains separate feature extractors, called experts, for each sensor. The decisive block of our model is the gating network, which online decides which sensor provides the data that is most relevant for driving. It then reconfigures the network by activating only the relevant expert corresponding to that sensor and deactivating the remaining ones. As a consequence, the model never extracts features from data that are irrelevant for driving. The gating network takes the data from all inputs and thus to avoid explosion of computation time and memory space it has to be realized as a small and shallow network. We verify our model on the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) comprising of the 1/6 scale remote control truck equipped with three cameras. We demonstrate that the reconfigurable network correctly chooses experts in real-time allowing the reduction of computations cost for the whole model without deteriorating its performance.

AB  - This paper is about fast motion estimation with scanning radar. We use weak supervision to train a focus of attention policy which actively down-samples the measurement stream before data association steps are undertaken. At training, we avoid laborious manual labelling by exploiting short-term sensor coherence from multiple poses in the presence of an external ego-motion estimator (for example, wheel odometry). In this way, we generate copious annotated measurements which can be used for training a learning algorithm in a weakly-supervised fashion. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in the context of a Radar Odometry (RO) task, pre-filtering raw data with a popular image segmentation network trained as presented. We evaluate our system against 26 km of data collected in Central Oxford and show consistent motion estimation with greatly reduced radar processing times (by a factor of 2.36).

AB  - We demonstrate an autonomous ground robot capable of exploring unknown indoor environments for reconstructing their 2D maps. This problem has been traditionally tackled by geometric heuristics and information theory. More recently, deep learning and reinforcement learning based approaches have been proposed to learn exploration behavior in an end-to-end manner. We present a method that combines the strengths of these different approaches. Specifically, we employ a state-of-the-art generative neural network to predict unknown regions of a partially explored map, and use the prediction to enhance the exploration in an information-theoretic manner. We evaluate our system in simulation using floor plans of real buildings. We also present comparisons with traditional methods which demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of exploration efficiency. We retain an advantage over end-to-end learned exploration methods in that the robot's behavior is easily explicable in terms of the predicted map.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in learning dynamics simulators for model-based control. Compared with off-the-shelf physics engines, a learnable simulator can quickly adapt to unseen objects, scenes, and tasks. However, existing models like interaction networks only work for fully observable systems; they also only consider pairwise interactions within a single time step, both restricting their use in practical systems. We introduce Propagation Networks (PropNet), a differentiable, learnable dynamics model that handles partially observable scenarios and enables instantaneous propagation of signals beyond pairwise interactions. With these innovations, our propagation networks not only outperform current learnable physics engines in forward simulation, but also achieves superior performance on various control tasks. Compared with existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms, model-based control with propagation networks is more accurate, efficient, and generalizable to novel, partially observable scenes and tasks.

AB  - Interactive driving is challenging but essential for autonomous cars in dense traffic or urban areas. Proper interaction requires understanding and prediction of future trajectories of all neighboring cars around a target vehicle. Current solutions typically assume a certain distribution or stochastic process to approximate human-driven cars' behaviors. To relax this assumption, a Recurrent Meta Induction Network (RMIN) framework is developed. The original Conditional Neural Process (CNP) on which this is based does not consider the sequence of the conditions, due to the permutation invariance requirements for stochastic processes. However, the sequential information is important for the driving behavior estimation. Therefore, in the proposed method, a recurrent neural cell replaces the original demonstration sub-net. The behavior estimation is conditioned on the historical observations for all related cars, including the target car and its surrounding cars. The method is applied to predict the lane change trajectory of a target car in dense traffic areas. The proposed method achieves better results than previous methods and thanks to the meta-learning framework, it can use a smaller dataset, putting fewer demands on autonomous driving data collection.

AB  - Fluidic transmission mechanisms use fluids to transmit force through conduits. We previously presented a transmission mechanism called solid-media transmission (SMT), which uses conduits filled with spheres and spacers for push-only bidirectional transmission. In this paper, we present new designs of SMT-actuated one-degree-of-freedom (DoF) and two-degree-of-freedom positioning manipulators, and report experiment studies to assess their performance. In these studies, closed-loop position control was performed with a PI controller and/or master-slave control. With braided PTFE tubing, SMT exhibited sub-millimeter accuracy, with a tolerance of ±0.05 mm for the tested transmission lines with lengths up to 4m.

AB  - Robotic grasping can enable mobile vehicles to physically interact with the environment for delivery, repositioning, or landing. However, the requirements for grippers on mobile vehicles differ substantially from those used for conventional manipulation. Specifically, grippers for dynamic mobile robots should be capable of rapid activation, high force density, low power consumption, and minimal computation. In this work, we present a biologically-inspired robotic gripper designed specifically for mobile platforms. This design exploits a bistable shell to achieve “reflexive” activation based on contact with the environment. The mechanism can close its grasp within 0. 12s without any sensing or control. Electrical input power is not required for grasping or holding load. The reflexive gripper utilizes a novel pneumatic design to open its grasp with low power, and the gripper can carry slung loads up to 28 times its weight. This new mechanism, including the kinematics, static behavior, control structure, and fabrication, is described in detail. A proof of concept prototype is designed, built, and tested. Experimental results are used to characterize performance and demonstrate the potential of these methods.

AB  - Small aerial robots usually face a common challenge: they can only fly for a short time due to their limited onboard energy supply. To tackle this issue, one promising solution is to endow flying robots with perching capability so that they can perch or land on walls, trees, or power lines to rest or recharge. Such perching capability is especially useful for monitoring-related tasks since the robot can maintain a desired height for monitoring without flying. One of the major challenges for perching is to design a light-weight and energy-efficient perching mechanism. In this paper, we present a 3D-printed compliant bistable gripper which is easy to close, stable to hold, and easy to adjust for a palm-size quadcopter to perch on cylindrical objects. If installed on the bottom of aerial robots, it can also be used for aerial grasping. The gripper can be directly activated by the impact force during contact to switch from open state to closed state. It can also hold the quadcopter safely since the required force to open the gripper is larger than the robot weight. We analyze the required forces for closing and opening to provide design guidelines for the mechanism. Experimental results show that the designed gripper can successful make the quadcopter perch on cylinders as well as grasp objects.

AB  - A novel nonlinear incremental optimization algorithm MH-iSAM2 is developed to handle ambiguity in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problems in a multi-hypothesis fashion. It can output multiple possible solutions for each variable according to the ambiguous inputs, which is expected to greatly enhance the robustness of autonomous systems as a whole. The algorithm consists of two data structures: an extension of the original Bayes tree that allows efficient multi-hypothesis inference, and a Hypo-tree that is designed to explicitly track and associate the hypotheses of each variable as well as all the inference processes for optimization. With our proposed hypothesis pruning strategy, MH-iSAM2 enables fast optimization and avoids the exponential growth of hypotheses. We evaluate MH-iSAM2 using both simulated datasets and real-world experiments, demonstrating its improvements on the robustness and accuracy of SLAM systems.

AB  - Motivated by the need to improve the performance of visual loop closure verification via multi-view geometry (MVG) under significant illumination and viewpoint changes, we propose a keypoint matching method that uses landmarks as an intermediate image representation in order to leverage the power of deep learning. In environments with various changes, the traditional verification method via MVG may encounter difficulty because of their inability to generate a sufficient number of correctly matched keypoints. Our method exploits the excellent invariance properties of convolutional neural network (ConvNet) features, which have shown outstanding performance for matching landmarks between images. By generating and matching landmarks first in the images and then matching the keypoints within the matched landmark pairs, we can significantly improve the quality of matched keypoints in terms of precision and recall measures. The proposed method is validated on challenging datasets that involve significant illumination and viewpoint changes, to establish its superior performance to the standard keypoint matching method.

AB  - Visual-inertial SLAM (VI-SLAM) requires a good initial estimation of the initial velocity, orientation with respect to gravity and gyroscope and accelerometer biases. In this paper we build on the initialization method proposed by Martinelli [1] and extended by Kaiser et al. [2], modifying it to be more general and efficient. We improve accuracy with several rounds of visual-inertial bundle adjustment, and robustify the method with novel observability and consensus tests, that discard erroneous solutions. Our results on the EuRoC dataset show that, while the original method produces scale errors up to 156%, our method is able to consistently initialize in less than two seconds with scale errors around 5%, which can be further reduced to less than 1% performing visual-inertial bundle adjustment after ten seconds.

AB  - In this paper, we address the problem of combining 3D laser scanner and camera information to estimate the motion of a mobile platform. We propose a direct laser-visual odometry approach building upon photometric image alignment. Our approach is designed to maximize the information usage of both, the image and the laser scan, to compute an accurate frame-to-frame motion estimate. To deal with the sparsity of the range measurements, our approach identifies planar point sets within individual point clouds and subsequently extract their corresponding pixel patches from the camera image. The extracted planar image patches are used together with the non-planar pixels to estimate the frame-to-frame motion using a homography formulation capable of incorporating both types of pixel alignments. To achieve high estimation accuracy, we explicitly predict possible occlusions caused by observations taken from different locations. We evaluate our proposed approach using the KITTI dataset as well as data recorded with a Clearpath Husky platform. The experiments suggest that our approach can achieve competitive estimation accuracy and produce consistently registered, colored point clouds.

AB  - Data association in SLAM is fundamentally challenging, and handling ambiguity well is crucial to achieve robust operation in real-world environments. When ambiguous measurements arise, conservatism often mandates that the measurement is discarded or a new landmark is initialized rather than risking an incorrect association. To address the inevitable “duplicate” landmarks that arise, we present an efficient map-merging framework to detect duplicate constellations of landmarks, providing a high-confidence loop-closure mechanism well-suited for object-level SLAM. This approach uses an incrementally-computable approximation of landmark uncertainty that only depends on local information in the SLAM graph, avoiding expensive recovery of the full system covariance matrix. This enables a search based on geometric consistency (GC) (rather than full joint compatibility (JC)) that inexpensively reduces the search space to a handful of “best” hypotheses. Furthermore, we reformulate the commonly-used interpretation tree to allow for more efficient integration of clique-based pairwise compatibility, accelerating the branch-and-bound max-cardinality search. Our method is demonstrated to match the performance of full JC methods at significantly-reduced computational cost, facilitating robust object-based loop-closure over large SLAM problems.

AB  - Robots are prone to making mistakes when performing manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. Robust policies are thus needed to not only avoid mistakes but also to recover from them. We propose a framework for increasing the robustness of contact-based manipulations by modeling the task structure and optimizing a policy for selecting skills and recovery skills. A multimodal state transition model is acquired based on the contact dynamics of the task and the observed transitions. A policy is then learned from the model using reinforcement learning. The policy is incrementally improved by expanding the action space by generating recovery skills with a heuristic. Evaluations on three simulated manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. The robot was able to complete the tasks despite multiple contact state changes and errors encountered, increasing the success rate averaged across the tasks from 70.0% to 95.3%.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the optimal kinematic control of a robot manipulator where the robot end effector position follows a task space trajectory. The joints are actuated with the desired velocity profile to achieve this task. This problem has been solved using a single network adaptive critic (SNAC) by expressing the forward kinematics as input affine system. Usually in SNAC, the critic weights are updated using back propagation algorithm while little attention is given to convergence to the optimal cost. In this paper, we propose a critic weight update law that ensures convergence to the desired optimal cost while guaranteeing the stability of the closed loop kinematic control. In kinematic control, the robot is required to reach a specific target position. This has been solved as an optimal regulation problem in the context of SNAC based kinematic control. When the robot is required to follow a time varying task space trajectory, then the kinematic control has been framed as an optimal tracking problem. For tracking, an augmented system consisting of tracking error and reference trajectory is constructed and the optimal control policy is derived using SNAC framework. The stability and performance of the system under the proposed novel weight tuning law is guaranteed using Lyapunov approach. The proposed kinematic control scheme has been validated in simulations and experimentally executed using a real six degrees of freedom (DOF) Universal Robot (UR) 10 manipulator.

AB  - This paper proposes a manipulability optimization control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator for Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS), which at the same time guarantees a Remote Center of Motion (RCM). The first degree of redundancy of the manipulator is used to achieve an RCM constraint, the second one is adopted for manipulability optimization. A hierarchical operational space formulation is introduced to integrate all the control components, including a Cartesian compliance control involving the main surgical task, a first null-space controller for the RCM constraint, and a second null-space controller for manipulability optimization. Experiments with virtual surgical tasks, in an augmented reality environment, were performed to validate the proposed control strategy using the KUKA LWR 4 +. The results demonstrate that end-effector accuracy and RCM constraint can be guaranteed, along with improving the manipulability of the surgical tip.

AB  - To minimize the operation time, mobile manipulators need to pick-up parts while the mobile base and the gripper are moving. The gripper speed needs to be selected to ensure that the pick-up operation does not fail due to uncertainties in part pose estimation. This, in turn, affects the mobile base trajectory. This paper presents an active learning based approach to construct a meta-model to estimate the probability of successful part pick-up for a given level of uncertainty in the part pose estimate. Using this model, we present an optimization-based framework to generate time-optimal trajectories that satisfy the given level of success probability threshold for picking-up the part.

AB  - We address the problem of executing tool-using manipulation skills in scenarios where the objects to be used may vary. We assume that point clouds of the tool and target object can be obtained, but no interpretation or further knowledge about these objects is provided. The system must interpret the point clouds and decide how to use the tool to complete a manipulation task with a target object; this means it must adjust motion trajectories appropriately to complete the task. We tackle three everyday manipulations: scraping material from a tool into a container, cutting, and scooping from a container. Our solution encodes these manipulation skills in a generic way, with parameters that can be filled in at run-time via queries to a robot perception module; the perception module abstracts the functional parts of the tool and extracts key parameters that are needed for the task. The approach is evaluated in simulation and with selected examples on a PR2 robot.

AB  - This paper presents 2D feedback control and open loop 3D trajectories of heterogeneous chemically catalyzing Janus particles. Self-actuated particles have enormous implications for both in vivo and in vitro environments, which make them a diverse resource for a variety of medical and assembly applications. Janus particles, consisting of cobalt and platinum hemispheres, can self-propel in hydrogen peroxide solutions due to platinum's catalyzation properties. These particles are directionally controlled using static magnetic fields produced from a triaxial approximate Helmholtz coil system. Since the magnetization direction of Janus particles is often heterogeneous, and thereby not consistent with the propulsion direction, this creates a unique opportunity to explore the motion effects of these particles under 2D feedback control and open loop 3D control. Using a modified closed loop controller, Janus particles with magnetization both closely aligned and greatly misaligned to the propulsion vectors, were instructed to perform complex trajectories. These trajectories were then compared between trials to measure both consistency and accuracy. The effects of increasing offset between the magnetization and propulsion vectors were also analyzed. The effects this heterogeneity had on 3D motion is also briefly discussed. It is our hope going forward to develop a 3D closed loop control system that can retroactively account for variations in the magnetization vector.

AB  - Hybrid systems, such as bipedal walkers, are challenging to control because of discontinuities in their nonlinear dynamics. Little can be predicted about the systems' evolution without modeling the guard conditions that govern transitions between hybrid modes, so even systems with reliable state sensing can be difficult to control. We propose an algorithm that allows for determining the hybrid mode of a system in real-time using data-driven analysis. The algorithm is used with data-driven dynamics identification to enable model predictive control based entirely on data. Two examples-a simulated hopper and experimental data from a bipedal walker-are used. In the context of the first example, we are able to closely approximate the dynamics of a hybrid SLIP model and then successfully use them for control in simulation. In the second example, we demonstrate gait partitioning of human walking data, accurately differentiating between stance and swing, as well as selected subphases of swing. We identify contact events, such as heel strike and toe-off, without a contact sensor using only kinematics data from the knee and hip joints, which could be particularly useful in providing online assistance during walking. Our algorithm does not assume a predefined gait structure or gait phase transitions, lending itself to segmentation of both healthy and pathological gaits. With this flexibility, impairment-specific rehabilitation strategies or assistance could be designed.

AB  - Walking gaits generated using Model Predictive Control (MPC) is widely used due to its capability to handle several constraints that characterize humanoid locomotion. The use of simplified models such as the Linear Inverted Pendulum allows to perform computations in real-time, giving the robot the fundamental capacity to replan its motion to follow external inputs (e.g. reference velocity, footstep plans). However, usually the MPC does not take into account the current state of the robot when computing the reference motion, losing the ability to react to external disturbances. In this paper a closed-loop MPC scheme is proposed to estimate the robot's real state through Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and proprioceptive sensors (force/torque). With the proposed control scheme it is shown that the robot is able to react to external disturbances (push), by stepping to recover from the loss of balance. Moreover the localization allows the robot to navigate to target positions in the environment without being affected by the drift generated by imperfect open-loop control execution. We validate the proposed scheme through two different experiments with a HRP-4 humanoid robot.

AB  - We propose a linear MPC scheme for online computation of reactive walking motions, necessary for fast interactions such as physical collaboration with humans or collision avoidance in crowds. Unlike other existing schemes, it provides fully adaptable height, adaptable step placement and complete kinematic and dynamic feasibility guarantees, making it possible to walk perfectly safely on a piecewise horizontal ground such as stairs. A linear formulation is proposed, based on efficiently bounding the nonlinear term introduced by vertical motion, considering two linear constraints instead of one nonlinear constraint. Balance and Passive Safety guarantees are secured by enforcing a 3D capturability constraint. Based on a comparison between CoM and CoP trajectories involving exponentials instead of polynomials, this capturability constraint involves a CoM motion stopping along a segment of line, always maintaining complete kinematic and dynamic feasibility.

AB  - We present a sampling-based framework for feedback motion planning of legged robots. Our framework is based on switching between limit cycles at a fixed instance of motion, the Poincaré section (e.g., apex or touchdown), by finding overlaps between the regions of attraction (ROA) of two limit cycles. First, we assume a candidate orbital Lyapunov function (OLF) and define a ROA at the Poincaré section. Next, we solve multiple trajectory optimization problems, one for each sampled initial condition on the ROA to minimize an energy metric and subject to the exponential convergence of the OLF between two steps. The result is a table of control actions and the corresponding initial conditions at the Poincaré section. Then we develop a control policy for each control action as a function of the initial condition using deep learning neural networks. The control policy is validated by testing on initial conditions sampled on ROA of randomly chosen limit cycles. Finally, the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm is adopted to plan transitions between the limit cycles using the ROAs. The approach is demonstrated on a hopper model to achieve velocity and height transitions between steps.

AB  - The compliant motion of humanoid robots is one of their most important characteristics for interacting with humans and various environments in the real world. During walking, compliant motion ensures stable contact between the foot and ground, but walking stability is degraded by position tracking performance and unknown disturbances. To address the issue of instability of humanoid robot walking with compliant motion control, this paper proposes a model for real-time walking pattern generation considering the motion control performance of a robot. The dynamic model of a robot with a motion controller is described as a second-order system approximating position tracking performance with a linear inverted pendulum model to determine the relationship between the zero-moment point and center of mass (CoM). The CoM trajectory is calculated using preview control based on the dynamics model and current state of the robot. Therefore, even if the robot has the low tracking performance due to compliant motion control, the walking stability can be ensured. The proposed method was implemented on our humanoid robot, DYROS-JET, and its performance was demonstrated through improved stability during walking.

AB  - The ability to accurately measure signal time-of-flight between ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communication transceivers, even in multipath environments, makes this technology ideally suited to develop ranging-based positioning systems, especially for indoor applications where GPS signals are not available. In recent years, low-cost commercial UWB transceivers have become more easily available and increasingly used to develop custom robot positioning systems. In this paper, we focus in particular on positioning techniques requiring the synchronization of base stations such as Time of Arrival (TOA) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA). We present a protocol based on Kalman filtering for simultaneous synchronization of multiple UWB base stations and positioning of an arbitrary number of passive UWB receivers. We illustrate experimentally using our protocol and an EKF-based navigation system design the level of accuracy achievable with small low-power UWB modules for mobile robot positioning. We discuss in details measurement errors and system tuning issues applicable to popular commercial UWB transceivers.

AB  - Many popular advanced sonar systems provide accurate and reliable measurements containing crucial info needed by robotic applications such as range, bearing and reflection strength of the objects in the field of view. While these sensor systems provide these crucial pieces of information accurately, they are often limited by a lack of processing power and/or size which leads to them needing an external computing device to process all the information generated by the microphone array on the sensor. In this paper we present two versions of a novel fully embedded 3D sonar sensor which have different sensing architectures which enable 3D perception for robotic application in harsh conditions using ultrasound at low cost. Experimental results taken from an office environment will show the 3D localization capabilities and performance of the sensor, showing the sensor has a large field-of-view (FoV) with accurate 3D localization combined with real-time capabilities.

AB  - A key capability for autonomous underground mining vehicles is real-time accurate localisation. While significant progress has been made, currently deployed systems have several limitations ranging from dependence on costly additional infrastructure to failure of both visual and range-sensor-based techniques in highly aliased or visually challenging environments. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight coarse vision-based localisation system that could map and then localise to within a few metres in an underground mining environment. However, this level of precision is insufficient for providing a cheaper, more reliable vision-based automation alternative to current range sensor-based systems. Here we present a new precision localisation system dubbed “LookUP”, which learns a neural-network-based pixel sampling strategy for estimating homographies based on ceiling-facing cameras without requiring any manual labelling. This new system runs in real time on limited computation resource and is demonstrated on two different underground mine sites, achieving real time performance at ~5 frames per second and a much improved average localisation error of ~1.2 metre.

AB  - Registration accuracy is influenced by the presence of outliers and numerous robust solutions have been developed over the years to mitigate their effect. However, without a large scale comparison of solutions to filter outliers, it is becoming tedious to select an appropriate algorithm for a given application. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the effects of outlier filters on the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm aimed at a mobile robotic application. Fourteen of the most common outlier filters (such as M-estimators) have been tested in different types of environments, for a total of more than two million registrations. Furthermore, the influence of tuning parameters has been thoroughly explored. The experimental results show that most outlier filters have a similar performance if they are correctly tuned. Nonetheless, filters such as Var. Trim., Cauchy, and Cauchy MAD are more stable against different environment types. Interestingly, the simple norm L1 produces comparable accuracy, while being parameterless.

AB  - Telepresence robots have been recently used for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). Since the robot can not track a person continuously, there are several strategies to decide when to check them, from cyclic checks to simple requests from users and/or caregivers. In order to adapt to the user needs and condition, it is preferable to perform CGA as soon as regularities appear. However, this requires detection of potential issues in users to offer immediate service. In this work we propose a new low cost force sensor system to detect user's condition and attract attention of CGA robots, so they can perform a full examination on a need basis. The main advantages of this system are: i) it can be attached to any standard commercial cane; ii) its power consumption is very reduced; and iii) it provides continuous information as long as the user walks. It has been tested with several elderly volunteers in care facilities. Results have proven that the sensor readings are indeed correlated with the users' condition.

AB  - This paper presents a three-tendon actuated continuum robot with an origami backbone to assist the elderly and physically impaired individuals in performing activities of daily living. The proposed design solution is an inherently safe and cost-effective alternative to current assistive robots. The origami backbone based on a variation of the Yoshimura pattern provides controlled deployment of the robot and enables length variation (15 cm - 56 cm) in order to increase the reachable workspace. A pneumatic stiffness mechanism was implemented, increasing the weight bearing capabilities of the continuum robot to 500 g. This new stiffness modulation approach was assessed with the use of several testing rigs. Additionally, the robot is joypad controlled and is easily transportable due to its high packing efficiency of 73% and light weight of 1.3 kg for the main body (including the actuation system). For demonstration of usability studies, the robot was successfully tested at a simulated kitchen terminal and also performed pick and place tasks.

AB  - In this paper, a novel, low-cost lower extremity gait rehabilitation device using a single actuator is presented. The proposed device is based on a single DOF 8-bar Jansen mechanism, which was recently introduced as an efficient walking mechanism for legged robots. The mechanism is synthesized to generate the ankle trajectory during human gait relative to the hip, in terms of both position and time. Two mechanisms, one for each lower limb, are applied reciprocally and mechanically synchronized to guarantee symmetric gait. A custom designed seat-type weight support system is also introduced. It supports weight of the user and mechanisms, and also provides the required interaction while maintaining mobility at the hip. To accommodate different users, several parameters of the mechanism are adjustable. Ease of donning-doffing action, weight-bearing and possibility of unhindered arm swing have been considered to provide an effective and user-friendly training environment. A prototype is manufactured, and a pilot study with a healthy subject is conducted to demonstrate feasibility of the concept. Due to ease of control, cost-effectiveness and high intrinsic safety, the proposed system potentially offers a possible method of gait training.

AB  - Series elastic actuators have proven to be an elegant response to the issue of safety around human-robot interaction. The compliant nature of series elastic actuators provides the potential to be applied in robot-aided rehabilitation for patients with upper and lower limb musculoskeletal injuries. This paper proposes a new series elastic actuator to be used in robot-aided musculoskeletal rehabilitation. The actuator is composed of a DC motor, a torsion spring, and a magnetic particle brake coupled to one common output shaft through a differential gear. The proposed topology focuses on three types of actuation modes most commonly used in rehabilitation, i.e., free motion, elastic, and assistive/resistive motion. A dynamic model of the actuator is presented and validated experimentally and the ability of the actuator to follow a reference torque is shown in different experimental scenarios.

AB  - Perforations in flexible endoscopy are life-threatening. Defect closure or suturing in flexible endoscopy has long been a critical challenge due to the confined space of the access routes and surgical sites, high dexterity and force demands of suturing tasks, as well as critical size and strength requirements of wound closure. This paper introduces a novel robotic suturing system for flexible endoscopic surgery. This system features a flexible, through-the-scope, five-degree-of-freedom robotic suturing instrument. This instrument allows the surgeon to endoscopically manipulate a needle via a master console to create running stitches and knots in flexible endoscopy, which is not possible with existing devices. Successful ex-vivo trials were conducted inside porcine colons to show how surgical stitches and knots can be endoscopically created and secured in a completely new way. This new technology will change the way how surgeons close defects or perforations in flexible endoscopic surgery.

AB  - Fully insertable laparoscopic cameras feature more locomotive flexibility in a larger workspace compared to conventional trocar-based laparoscopes and thus represent a promising future of minimally invasive surgery. These cameras are principally anchored and actuated by transabdominal magnetic coupling. Although several proof-of-concept prototypes have shown the technical feasibility in terms of camera actuation and laparoscopic imaging, none of them are getting close to clinical practice due to concerns about safety. One common problem lies in that the interaction force between the camera and the abdominal wall tissue is completely unknown and not controlled. The camera is being manipulated in an open loop which exposes the patient to a high risk of being injured. In this paper, a noninvasive real-time camera-tissue interaction force measurement approach for an insertable laparoscopic camera is proposed, implemented, and validated.Ex-vivo experiments using a simulated abdominal cavity have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach during anchoring, translation, and rotation camera behaviors. Potential surgical impacts enabled by the force feedback have also been exemplified by a robotic-assisted camera control experiment using shared autonomy.

AB  - Despite the recent advances in soft endoscopes, they could not yet fully fulfill the requirements for minimally invasive and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgeries. Maneuverability, bendability, different structural stiffness required for different endoscopic surgical interventions, the space needed for surgical manipulators and patient's safety are amongst the main factors which can contribute to implementing the new soft robotics endoscope in practice. In this study, based on finite element analysis on an existing endoscopic segment, a new improved endoscopic module was developed. A novel approach for stiffening of the endoscopic module was proposed. The actuation and stiffening components were combined to introduce a multi-level stiffening mechanism to the endoscope, and also to provide a free lumen for manipulators. To increase patient's safety, a force sensing module was developed to estimate the magnitude and direction of the force from tissues to the endoscope. The developed endoscopic system was integrated to a haptic control system. The 3D kinematics control and haptic feedback control of the endoscopic module were validated.

AB  - In this paper, we present the design of a steerable needle with proximal notch patterns for compliance and an embedded rotational tip joint for articulation. The device is fabricated by laser machining NiTi tube so that an inner working channel exists (to enable delivery of fluids, drugs or microtools) and no assembly is required for the joints. We formulate its model based on the classical Cosserat Rod theory. This is extended with incremental state prediction and a simple spring model for tissue reaction to integrate into a planning algorithm based on Dynamic Region RRT which efficiently explores the needle's state space. The planner was initialized with a target zone and arbitrary anatomical obstacles before running simulations which propagated incremental state changes at every step while adhering to constraints based on the physical system. Finally, we demonstrate the steering capability of the needle through insertion tests into a phantom.

AB  - Compared to open surgical techniques, laparoscopic surgical methods aim to reduce the collateral tissue damage and hence decrease the patient recovery time. However, constraints imposed by the laparoscopic surgery, i.e. the operation of surgical tools in limited spaces, turn simple surgical tasks such as suturing into time-consuming and inconsistent tasks for surgeons. In this paper, we develop an autonomous laparoscopic robotic suturing system. More specific, we expand our smart tissue anastomosis robot (STAR) by developing i) a new 3D imaging endoscope, ii) a novel actuated laparoscopic suturing tool, and iii) a suture planning strategy for the autonomous suturing. We experimentally test the accuracy and consistency of our developed system and compare it to sutures performed manually by surgeons. Our test results on suture pads indicate that STAR can reach 2.9 times better consistency in suture spacing compared to manual method and also eliminate suture repositioning and adjustments. Moreover, the consistency of suture bite sizes obtained by STAR matches with those obtained by manual suturing.

AB  - Recent advances in teleoperation-based robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) have made significant inroads in clinical adoption. However, such master-slave surgical systems create a physical separation between the surgeon and the patient. The concept of Active Constraints (ACs) provides guidance and sensory information to surgical robot operators in a form of haptic, visual or audible cues. This work proposes a novel ACs approach to avoid surgical tool-clashing and collision of the tool-shaft with delicate anatomy using elasto-plastic frictional force control. The presented framework is designed to reduce the occurence of direct coupling during electrocautery and to protect high-risk regions in Minimally Invasive Partial Nephrectomy (MIPN). Moreover, we combine aforementioned ACs methods and propose a solution when simultaneous penetration of both constraints occurs. The proposed methodology is implemented on the teleoperated da Vinci Surgical System using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and its performance is demonstrated through three types of user experiments. The experimental results show that the developed algorithms are of significant benefit in performing the tasks with ACs assistance.

AB  - Passivity is a necessary condition for a system's stability, meaning that an energy generating system may readily become unstable. Energy-aware actuation can enforce passivity by monitoring the amount of energy that is exchanged with a system, while using an allocated energy budget to execute a task. Careful communication of the energy budgets is important to prevent accidental generation of energy. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy transaction protocol to communicate energy budgets in a distributed robotic system to guarantee that passivity is kept. Simulations are performed with a model of the protocol that is applied to a simulated unreliable communication channel. It is verified that the proposed protocol keeps passivity in the system, while a naive communication strategy either violates passivity or is unnecessarily dissipative.

AB  - Performing ultrasound procedures from a remote site is a challenging task since both a stable behavior, for the safety of the patient, and a high-level of usability, to exploit the sonographer's expertise, need to be guaranteed. Furthermore, a teleoperation system that provides such requirements has to deal with communication delays as well. To address this issue, we use the two-layer algorithm: a passivity-based bilateral teleoperation architecture able to guarantee stability despite unknown and time-varying delay. Its flexibility allows to implement different kinds of control laws. In a Tele-Echography system, the slave manipulator has to apply significant forces needed by the procedure whereas the haptic device at the master side should be very light to avoid tiring the operator. Therefore, the energy needed by these two robots to perform their movements is very different and the energy injected into the system by the operator is often not sufficient to implement the desired action at the slave side. Methods to overcome this problem require to perfectly know the dynamical models of the robots. The solution proposed in this paper does not require such knowledge and is based on properly scaling the energy exchanged between the master and the slave side. We show the effectiveness of this approach in a real setup using a TOUCH haptic device and a WAM Barrett robot holding an ultrasound probe.

AB  - We present a method for EMG-driven teleoperation of non-anthropomorphic robot hands. EMG sensors are appealing as a wearable, inexpensive, and unobtrusive way to gather information about the teleoperator's hand pose. However, mapping from EMG signals to the pose space of a non-anthropomorphic hand presents multiple challenges. We present a method that first projects from forearm EMG into a subspace relevant to teleoperation. To increase robustness, we use a model which combines continuous and discrete predictors along different dimensions of this subspace. We then project from the teleoperation subspace into the pose space of the robot hand. Our method is effective and intuitive, as it enables novice users to teleoperate pick and place tasks faster and more robustly than state-of-the-art EMG teleoperation methods when applied to a non-anthropomorphic, multi-DOF robot hand.

AB  - Passivity has been the most often used constraint for the stable controller design of bilateral teleoperation systems. Especially, Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) has been used in many applications since it has been known as one of the least conservative passivity-based approaches. Although TDPA were able to stabilize the system with the least conservatism, it has its own drawbacks as the cost of achieving the least conservative passivity especially when there is communication time-delay. Due to the on/off bang-bang control-like modification for instantaneous passivity recovery, it has high frequency force vibrations on the slave and especially master side. By implementing a virtual mass-spring system between the passivity controller and master device, these high frequency vibration has been eliminated. However, the gains need proper tuning as they are dependent on the teleoperation setup and application. It also tends to make the system sluggish which further distorts the transparency. We propose a new observer-based gradient controller to eliminate the force jittering on the master side. It rectifies the delayed feedback force by removing the undesired increase in force which is generated by the delay in communication channel. It does not require any system parameters and there are no gains to tune, thus it can be added to any teleoperator irrespective of its dynamics and without having any prior system information. The proposed approach was implemented to a position-force bilateral teleoperation system, and compared with TDPA with virtual mass spring with round-trip delays of up to 500 ms for hard wall contacts.

AB  - Robotic teleoperation brings great potential for advances within the field of surgery. The ability of a surgeon to reach patient remotely opens exciting opportunities. Early experience with telerobotic surgery has been interesting, but the clinical feasibility remains out of reach, largely due to the deleterious effects of communication delays. Teleoperation tasks are significantly impacted by unavoidable signal latency, which directly results in slower operations, less precision in movements, and increased human errors. Introducing significant changes to the surgical workflow, for example by introducing semi-automation or self-correction, present too significant a technological and ethical burden for commercial surgical robotic systems to adopt. In this paper, we present three simple and intuitive motion scaling solutions to combat teleoperated robotic systems under delay and help improve operator accuracy. Motion scaling offers potentially improved user performance and reduction in errors with minimal change to the underlying teleoperation architecture. To validate the use of motion scaling as a performance enhancer in telesurgery, we conducted a user study with 17 participants, and our results show that the proposed solutions do indeed reduce the error rate when operating under high delay.

AB  - Grasping objects in a cluttered environment is challenging due to the lack of collision free grasp affordances. In such conditions, the target object touches or is covered by other objects in the scene, resulting in a failed grasp. To address this problem, we propose a strategy of singulating the object from its surrounding clutter, which consists of previously unseen objects, by means of lateral pushing movements. We employ reinforcement learning for obtaining optimal push policies given depth observations of the scene. The action-value function(Q-function) is approximated with a deep neural network. We train the robot in simulation and we demonstrate that the transfer of learned policies to the real environment is robust.

AB  - We present an integrated grasping system for a mobile manipulator to grasp an unknown object of interest (OI) in an unknown environment. The system autonomously scans its environment, models the OI, plans and executes a grasp, while taking into account base pose uncertainty. Due to inherent line of sight limitations in sensing, a single scan of the OI often does not reveal enough information to complete grasp analysis; as a result, our system autonomously builds a model of an object via multiple scans from different locations until a grasp can be performed. A volumetric next-best-view (NBV) algorithm is used to model an arbitrary object and terminates modeling when force closure for the gripper is satisfied. Two experiments are presented: i) modeling and registration error is reduced by selecting viewpoints with more scan overlap, and ii) model reconstruction and grasps are successfully achieved while experiencing base pose uncertainty.

AB  - In this paper we address the problem of creating planar caging grasps on objects using simple, underactuated grippers with no sensing or control. Specifically, we examine how changes in mechanical compliance, passive adaptability due to underactuation, and finger phalanx length affect the ability to create caging grasps passively, by altering the free-swing motion of the fingers. We present a simple model for simulating the underactuated hand, develop a metric for quantifying a hand design's caging ability, and perform a design parameter space search to reveal the important design factors influencing passive caging behavior. The results show that both palm width and the interplay between joint spring stiffness and pulley radius ratios play the largest roles in determining caging behavior. The effect of varying design parameters on the caging grasp performance of the hand is discussed, the best resulting design is shown, and a list of principles to guide the design of simple underactuated hands for caging grasps is presented.

AB  - When operating in unstructured environments such as warehouses, homes, and retail centers, robots are frequently required to interactively search for and retrieve specific objects from cluttered bins, shelves, or tables. Mechanical Search describes the class of tasks where the goal is to locate and extract a known target object. In this paper, we formalize Mechanical Search and study a version where distractor objects are heaped over the target object in a bin. The robot uses an RGBD perception system and control policies to iteratively select, parameterize, and perform one of 3 actions - push, suction, grasp - until the target object is extracted, or either a time limit is exceeded, or no high confidence push or grasp is available. We present a study of 5 algorithmic policies for mechanical search, with 15,000 simulated trials and 300 physical trials for heaps ranging from 10 to 20 objects. Results suggest that success can be achieved in this long-horizon task with algorithmic policies in over 95% of instances and that the number of actions required scales approximately linearly with the size of the heap.

AB  - We present a new approach to transfer grasp configurations from prior example objects to novel objects. We assume the novel and example objects have the same topology and similar shapes. We perform 3D segmentation on these objects using geometric and semantic shape characteristics. We compute a grasp space for each part of the example object using active learning. We build bijective contact mapping between these model parts and compute the corresponding grasps for novel objects. Finally, we assemble the individual parts and use local replanning to adjust grasp configurations while maintaining its stability and physical constraints. Our approach is general, can handle all kind of objects represented using mesh or point cloud and a variety of robotic hands.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) parallel mechanism having 3 translational DOFs and 1 rotational DOF. The mechanism comprises 2 sets of parallelogram linkages, which constrain two of the rotational DOFs of the mechanism. An interesting feature of the mechanism is that it can be driven using 4 parallel sliders mounted on its base. As a result, one of the translational DOFs can be infinitely large. Also, the architecture of the mechanism provides a large rotational DOF in one direction. The kinematic equations of the mechanism are derived and the Jacobian matrices are obtained. The mathematical conditions that lead to singularities are also found. Moreover, a geometric description of the boundaries of the workspace is given, which can be expressed using simple equations. Finally, some design examples are proposed and a prototype is presented.

The kinematic model is developed based on the constraint conditions of the robot. It is shown that the type II (parallel) singularities can be completely avoided, thereby greatly extending the orientational workspace. Mechanisms are then introduced to use the redundant degrees of freedom of the robot to operate a gripper with the robot actuators, which are mounted on or close to the base. A CAD model of the robot is shown and a computer animation is provided to demonstrate the resulting architecture, which has full 6-dof capabilities and a large orientational workspace.

AB  - In this paper, we propose and investigate a new approach to modeling variable curvature continuum robot sections, based on Euler spirals. Euler spirals, also termed Clothoids, or Cornu spirals, are those curves in which the curvature increases linearly with their arc length. In this work, Euler spirals are applied to the kinematic modeling of continuum robots for the first time. The approach was evaluated using the sections of numerous continuum robots, including two novel parallel continuum robots. Each robot consists of three parallel sections, each with three thin, long McKibben actuators. These sections are poorly modeled by the widely used constant curvature kinematic model. The constant curvature and Euler spiral models were compared and the Euler spiral method was seen to be a significantly better match for a wide range of configurations of the robot hardware.

AB  - This paper presents a variable damping control strategy to improve trade-off between agility/performance and stability in the control of the ankle exoskeleton robot. Depending on the user's intent of movement, the proposed variable damping controller determines the robotic ankle damping from negative to positive damping values. The range of damping values is determined by incorporating the knowledge of human ankle damping in order to always secure stability of the ankle joint of the coupled human-robot system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we performed a set of human experiments with three different robotic damping conditions: fixed positive damping, fixed negative damping, and variable damping. Comparison of the two fixed damping conditions confirmed that there exists a clear trade-off between ankle agility and stability. Further, analysis of the variable damping condition demonstrated that humans could get benefits of not only positive damping to stabilize the ankle but also negative damping to enhance the agility of ankle movement as necessary during dynamic ankle movement. On average, the variable damping condition improved the agility of ankle movement by 76% and stability by 37% compared to the constant positive damping condition and the constant negative damping condition, respectively. Outcomes of this study would allow us to design a robotic controller that significantly improves agility/performance of the human-robot system without compromising its coupled stability.

AB  - Lower-limb exoskeletons are of great interest in the robotics community because of their various applications in enhancement and rehabilitation. In this paper we present an autonomous exoskeleton platform for ankle plantarflexion assistance. The untethered exoskeleton has a high efficiency transmission system with reduction ratio of 27.4:1. This allows relocating the actuator to the wearer's hip, which reduces device inertia. A feed-forward controller based on field oriented control was implemented to control the brushless DC motor on the exoskeleton. Through various performance tests, the exoskeleton was shown to provide a torque control bandwidth of 17.5Hz and can effectively track biological torque profiles. The augmentation factor (AF) of the exoskeleton is 64.7W, implying potential to reduce walking metabolic cost. This exoskeleton establishes an autonomous platform for experiments involving ankle assistance.

AB  - Collision checking and avoidance is an import part of the perception and planning system for autonomous driving. We present a new analytic approach to calculate the probability of a future collision and extend another already known solution to be suitable for ground vehicle navigation. Our new concept of the collision octagon facilitates in both cases the derivation of an analytic solution. Both approaches are compared to each other using simulated and real world scenarios. By comparing the results of the analytic solutions to the corresponding Monte Carlo simulations, their accuracy and real-time capability is demonstrated. The suitability of the analytic solutions for real world autonomous systems is further proven by integrating them into the trajectory prediction and planning system of the self-driving car of the Freie Universität Berlin.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for a car navigation system to follow a road path consisting on a sequence of lanelets. The motion control is divided into high-level planning that produces the road path and lower-level reactive control that safely follows the path. The approach presented here is the lower-level reactive control that combines the simple pure pursuit method to obtain a reference curvature with the beam curvature method (BCM) that keeps the car in the center of the free space in the lane avoiding obstacles that can partially block the lane. The whole system has been applied to an autonomous vehicle aimed for elderly or disable people.

AB  - In this paper, we propose the reinforcement learning based multi-robot collision avoidance approach by learning collision. Dynamical path re-planning, which is massively used in classical collision avoidance methods, needs overall information of the environment. Also, training agent robots to avoid the collision and pursue a goal point simultaneously is inefficient since the agent should learn two tasks. As the number of tasks that the agent should learn increases, it is difficult to make the performance of an algorithm consistent, which is known as reproducibility issue. To overcome these limitations, Collision Avoidance by Learning Collision (CALC), which learns collision instead of avoiding an obstacle robot is suggested. To solve the collision avoidance problem efficiently, the proposed method divides the problem into training and planning. In the training algorithm, an agent robot learns how to collide with a single obstacle robot and then generates a trained policy. With the trained policy, the agent can pursue a goal point since the policy leads the agent to `collide' with the goal. Furthermore, by taking action in a reverse way from the trained policy, the agent can avoid multiple obstacle robots in the planning algorithm at once. The proposed method is validated both in the robot simulation and real robot experiment, and compared with the existing collision avoidance method.

AB  - Collision detection has attracted attention of researchers for decades in the field of computer graphics, robot motion planning, computer aided design, etc. A large number of successful algorithms have been proposed and applied, which make use of convex polytopes and bounding volumes as primitives. However, algorithms for those shapes rely significantly on the complexity of the meshes. This paper deals with collision detection for shapes with simple and exact mathematical descriptions, such as ellipsoids and superquadrics. These primitives have a wide range of applications in representing complex objects and have much fewer parameters than meshes. The foundation of the proposed collision detection scheme relies on the closed-form Minkowski sums between ellipsoids and superquadrics in n-dimensional Euclidean space. The basic idea here is to shrink the ellipsoid into a point and expand each superquadric into a new offset surface with closed-form parametric expression. The solutions for detecting relative positions between a point and a general convex differentiable parametric surface in both 2D and 3D are derived, leading to an algorithm for exact collision detection. To compare between exact and inexact algorithms, an accuracy metric is introduced based on the Principal Kinematic Formula (PKF). The proposed algorithm is then compared with existing wellknown algorithms: Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) and Algebraic Separation Conditions (ASC). The results show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively with these efficient checkers.

AB  - Localization is a pre-requisite for most autonomous robots. For example, to carry out precision agriculture tasks effectively, a robot must be able to localize itself accurately in crop fields. The crop field environment presents unique challenges such as the highly repetitive structure of the crops leading to visual aliasing as well as the continuously changing appearance of the field, which makes it difficult to localize over time. In this paper, we present a localization system, which uses an aerial map of the field and exploits the semantic information of the crops, weeds, and their stem positions to resolve the visual ambiguity problem and to enable robot localization over extended periods of time. We evaluate our approach on a real field over multiple sessions spanning several weeks. Experiments suggest that our approach provides the necessary accuracy required by precision agriculture applications and works in cases where current techniques using typical visual features tend to fail.

AB  - Monocular simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) is a cheap and energy efficient way to enable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to safely navigate managed forests and gather data crucial for monitoring tree health. SLAM research, however, has mostly been conducted in structured human environments, and as such is poorly adapted to unstructured forests. In this paper, we compare the performance of state of the art monocular SLAM systems on forest data and use visual appearance statistics to characterise the differences between forests and other environments, including a photorealistic simulated forest. We find that SLAM systems struggle with all but the most straightforward forest terrain and identify key attributes (lighting changes and in-scene motion) which distinguish forest scenes from “classic” urban datasets. These differences offer an insight into what makes forests harder to map and open the way for targeted improvements. We also demonstrate that even simulations that look impressive to the human eye can fail to properly reflect the difficult attributes of the environment they simulate, and provide suggestions for more closely mimicking natural scenes.

AB  - This paper presents a pipeline for semantic segmentation of trees into their components. Given a single RGB-D image of a tree, we employ a deep network to predict labels to classify each pixel of the tree into trunk, branches, twigs and leaves. Multiple convolutional neural network architectures to combine the complementary modalities of depth and colour data are investigated. An asynchronous training approach where two networks trained separately on RGB and depth encoded as a 3-channel HHA image are combined using a late fusion architecture with different learning rates performs the best. Training and evaluation are performed on a synthetic dataset of 6 species of broadleaf trees. We further demonstrate the network's generalization capabilities, across various tree species on the synthetic dataset, achieving an accuracy of upto 92.5%. Furthermore, we present a qualitative evaluation of our approach on real-world data.

AB  - This work proposes a new strategy for autonomous navigation of mobile robots in sugarcane plantations based on thermal imaging. Unlike ordinary agricultural fields, sugarcane farms are generally vast and accommodates numerous arrangements of row crop tunnels, which are very tall, dense and hard-to-access. Moreover, sugarcane crops lie in harsh regions, which hinder the logistics for employing staff and heavy machinery for mapping, monitoring, and sampling. One solution for this problem is TIBA (Tankette for Intelligent BioEnergy Agriculture), a low-cost skid-steering mobile robot capable of infiltrating the crop tunnels with several sensing/sampling systems. The project concept is to reduce the product cost for making the deployment of a robot swarm feasible over a larger area. A prototype was built and tested in a bioenergy farm in order to improve the understanding of the environment and bring about the challenges for the next development steps. The major problem is the navigation through the crop tunnels, since most of the developed systems are suitable for open field operations and employ laser scanners and/or GPS/IMU, which in general are expensive technologies. In this context, we propose a low-cost solution based on infrared (IR) thermal imaging. IR cameras are simple and inexpensive devices, which do not pose risks to the user health, unlike laser-based sensors. This idea was highly motivated by the data collected in the field, which have shown a significant temperature difference between the ground and the crop. From the image analysis, it is possible to clearly visualize a distinguishable corridor and, consequently, generate a straight path for the robot to follow by using computationally efficient approaches. A rigorous analysis of the collected thermal data, numerical simulations and preliminary experiments in the real environment were included to illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed navigation methodology.

AB  - Nowadays, robots can navigate complex and dynamic environments such as air, water, and different terrain. However, moving into the underground, and especially into the soil, is still a challenge. Soil is a complex environment, and its exploration and monitoring is a crucial aspect in different engineering fields. Although some robotic solutions for mapping the soil are available, none of them can navigate into it. In this work, we propose a new solution for dynamic obstacles detection by embedding a 6-axis force torque sensor into a plant-inspired robot for soil exploration. We measured the forces acting on the apical part of the robot while it penetrates the soil by growing. We tested the system in different configurations, and at different depths. Results show that it is possible to identify the relative position of the obstacle before touching it with the robot. By using the proposed method as control feedback it is possible to move toward the development of novel robotic systems for navigating in complex and dynamic environments, such as the soil.

AB  - To match the ever increasing standards of fresh products, and the need to reduce waste, we devise an alternative to the destructive and highly variable fruit ripeness estimation by a penetrometer. We propose a fully automatic method to assess the ripeness of mango which is non-destructive, allows the user to test multiple surface areas with a single touch and is capable of dissociating between ripe and non-ripe fruits. A custom-made gripper equipped with a capacitive tactile sensor array is used to palpate the fruit. The ripeness is estimated as mango stiffness extracted through a simplified spring model. We test the framework on a set of 25 mangoes of the Keitt variety, and compare the results to penetrometer measurements. We show it is possible to correctly classify 88% of the mango without removing the skin of the fruit. The method can be a valuable substitute for non-destructive fruit ripeness testing. To the authors knowledge, this is the first robotics ripeness estimation system based on capacitive tactile sensing technology.

AB  - We propose an image-based cross-view geolocalization method that estimates the global pose of a UAV with the aid of georeferenced satellite imagery. Our method consists of two Siamese neural networks that extract relevant features despite large differences in viewpoints. The input to our method is an aerial UAV image and nearby satellite images, and the output is the weighted global pose estimate of the UAV camera. We also present a framework to integrate our crossview geolocalization output with visual odometry through a Kalman filter. We build a dataset of simulated UAV images and satellite imagery to train and test our networks. We show that our method performs better than previous camera pose estimation methods, and we demonstrate our networks ability to generalize well to test datasets with unseen images. Finally, we show that integrating our method with visual odometry significantly reduces trajectory estimation errors.

AB  - State-of-the-art forward facing monocular visual-inertial odometry algorithms are often brittle in practice, especially whilst dealing with initialisation and motion in directions that render the state unobservable. In such cases having a reliable complementary odometry algorithm enables robust and resilient flight. Using the common local planarity assumption, we present a fast, dense, and direct frame-to-frame visual-inertial odometry algorithm for downward facing cameras that minimises a joint cost function involving a homography based photometric cost and an IMU regularisation term. Via extensive evaluation in a variety of scenarios we demonstrate superior performance than existing state-of-the-art downward facing odometry algorithms for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs).

AB  - The development of intelligent drones has simplified aerial filming and provided smarter assistant tools for users to capture a film-look footage. Existing methods of autonomous aerial filming either specify predefined camera movements for a drone to capture a footage, or employ heuristic approaches for camera motion planning. However, both predefined movements and heuristically planned motions are hardly able to provide cinematic footages for various dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a data-driven learning-based approach, which can imitate a professional cameraman's intention for capturing a film-look aerial footage of a single subject in real-time. We model the decision-making process of the cameraman with two steps: 1) we train a network to predict the future image composition and camera position, and 2) our system then generates control commands to achieve the desired shot framing. At the system level, we deploy our algorithm on the limited resources of a drone and demonstrate the feasibility of running automatic filming onboard in real-time. Our experiments show how our data-driven planning approach achieves film-look footages and successfully mimics the work of a professional cameraman.

A deterministic model is presented to characterize the flight of the MIST-UAV in simulation. Experimental results from the platform demonstrate for the first time successful in-air transformation from multi-rotor, tail-sitter, and fixed-wing operation. Experiments also validated transformation repeatability, successfully testing multiple sequential transformations.

AB  - Accurate knowledge of geometric and inertia parameters are a necessity for precise and robust control of aerial vehicles. We propose a novel filter that is able to fuse motor speed, inertia, and pose measurements to estimate the vehicle's key dynamic properties online. The presented framework is able to estimate the multirotor's moment of inertia, mass, center of mass and each sensor module's relative position. Obtaining these estimates in-flight allow the multirotor to be precisely controlled even during tasks such as load transportation or after configuration changes on scene. We provide a nonlinear observability analysis, proving that the presented model is locally weakly observable. Experimental results validate the proposed approach, showing the ability to estimate the dynamic properties accurately and demonstrate its capability to do so even while additional loads are added. The framework is flexible and can easily be adapted to a wide range of applications, including self-calibration, object grasping, and single robot or multi-robot payload transportation.

AB  - External wrench estimation is very helpful for aerial exploration and manipulation tasks. During the exploration, there might be unseen obstacles to cause dangerous collisions. The estimation of the external force and torque is also beneficial in aerial manipulation tasks. In this paper, we present a framework of estimating the external wrench for the aerial multilink robot based on the onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, joints state and robot dynamic models. Compared to the conventional multirotor robot, the center of mass (CoM) is always changing when the robot transforms. The sensor could not be attached to CoM to observe the acceleration data. Consequently, we present a novel method by applying a distributed IMU system to estimate the CoM linear and angular accelerations for the external wrench estimation. With the help of the robot model, the position of the contact point could be estimated, which is useful in exploring tasks to safely interact with the physical world. We design the contact-aided navigation strategy and computationally efficient motion primitives library to help our robot react to the unexpected collision. We experimentally validate our framework with a two-dimensional multilink aerial robot to show the results of external wrench estimator and its further applications2.2Experiment video: https://youtu.be/R-WDReLnWWI

AB  - We develop two cooperative robots for power transmission lines (PTLs) inspection - a light climbing robot (CBR) which can stably move on the overhead ground wire (OGW) for sensor data collection and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a grabbing mechanism, which can automatically put the CBR on the OGW and take it off. In order to guarantee the safety, the mechanical structures of the connectors are designed in the shape of a trumpet. Further, a self-locked structure of the CBR is developed to automatically seize and release the OGW. For autonomous navigation, the UAV is equipped with a movable sliding rail and a 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF). The LRF can not only detect the position and orientation of the OGW but also detect the top beam of the CBR and the grabbing position in it. Furthermore, the action of the grabbing mechanism is automatically triggered by a microswitch. Finally, by the developed UAV and CBR platforms, we test the whole loading and unloading strategy in an artificially constructed PTLs environment outdoors and achieve an encouraging result1. Combining the flexible motion of the UAV and the high inspection accuracy of the CBR, the CBR can negotiate any obstacle by flying and abandon the traditional heavy obstacle crossing mechanism to effectively realize close-proximity inspection. Due to the light weight and low power consumption, the CBRs can be deployed once in many power corridors to conduct a long-term inspection.

AB  - Unauthorized drone flights near aircraft, airports, and emergency operations compromise the safety of passengers and bystanders. A detection system that can quickly find and track drones could help mitigate the risk of unauthorized drone flights. In this work, we show how a consumer drone outfitted with antennas and commodity radios can autonomously localize another drone by its telemetry radio emissions. We show how a non-myopic planner improves tracking performance over traditionally used greedy, one-step planners. Improved tracking is validated with simulations and the system is demonstrated with real drones in flight tests.

AB  - Cell microinjection plays an important role in genetics, transgenics, and other biomedical fields. As compared with manual cell microinjection and position-based robotic cell microinjection, force-assisted robotic cell microinjection can improve the success rate and survival rate of the injected cells. In this paper, a novel force-sensing cell injector is designed with piezoresistive force sensor embedded in soft materials. The soft sensors act as fixed-guided beams, which are introduced to achieve the force measurement with high sensitivity in pure one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) direction. The injector is developed by considering the installation and replacement issues of the micropipette as well as the connection convenience between the micropipette and tube of compressed air. A prototype of the cell injector with the force sensor is fabricated. Experimental study is conducted to verify its performance in practice.
