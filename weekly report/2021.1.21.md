#### Local Obstacle-Skirting Path Planning for a Fast Bi-steerable Rover using Bezier Curves：

1. This approach calculates a new local path for the vehicle using **a set of cubic Bezier curves** once the safety distance is not respected；

2. 在全局离线参考线的基础上，step1，提取**waypoints**（机器人动力学和障碍物），step2，在线贝茨曲线平滑waypoints，作为约束模型预测控制的参考，进行跟踪，使得曲线转角前后一致The tracking of the chosen path is ensured by a constrained model predictive control that computes the optimal and dynamically-consistent front and rear steering angles

    In such kinds of applications, AGVs need highly accurate and stable controllers, which are globally based on **two fundamental levels**. The first level is a **high-level controller** that allows the perception of the environment surrounding the vehicle and path planning with obstacle avoidance（The target of the high level controller is to avoid detected obstacles and keep the vehicle close to the global reference path）. The second level is a **low-level controller** dedicated to track the planned path by controlling the vehicle actuators while satisfying various constraints.

   ##### potential field approach

   drawback：local obstacle avoidance based on the potential field approach. This method is very elegant, however as it is applied in the configuration space, it is not suitable for non-holonomic and dynamically constrained systems. In addition to this, the gradient function of the potential field may converge to a local minimum making the robot stuck
   
3. uses also B´ezier curves in path planning for a car- like mobile robot by **taking into account the turning radius curvature constraint**

4. methodology

    + The first one is used for avoidance of detected obstacles, and the second one is for returning back to global desired path（**continuity and differentiability**）

    + Extraction of the final point and the avoidance point
    + 采样n*n个di和dm，满足曲率小于极限曲率，寻找最小值k? = argmin |ρk| ∀k∈[1,m],
